dave feldman, vice president of product design at heap, chatbots didn’t just take on one difficult problem and fail: they took on several and failed all of them.\\nbots can interface with users in different ways. the big divide is text vs. speech. in the beginning (of computer interfaces) was the (written) word.\\nusers had to type commands manually into a machine to get anything done.\\nthen, graphical user interfaces (guis) came along and saved the day. we became entranced by windows, mouse clicks, icons. and hey, we eventually got color, too!\\nmeanwhile, a bunch of research scientists were busily developing natural language (nl) interfaces to databases, instead of having to learn an arcane database query language.\\nanother bunch of scientists were developing speech-processing software so that you could just speak to your computer, rather than having to type. this turned out to be a whole lot more difficult than anyone originally realised:\\nthe next item on the agenda was holding a two-way dialog with a machine. here’s an example dialog (dating back to the 1990s) with vcr setup system:\\npretty cool, right? the system takes turns in collaborative way, and does a smart job of figuring out what the user wants.\\nit was carefully crafted to deal with conversations involving vcrs, and could only operate within strict limitations.\\nmodern day bots, whether they use typed or spoken input, have to face all these challenges, but also work in an efficient and scalable way on a variety of platforms.\\nbasically, we’re still trying to achieve the same innovations we were 30 years ago.\\nhere’s where i think we’re going wrong:\\nan oversized assumption has been that apps are ‘over’, and would be replaced by bots.\\nby pitting two such disparate concepts against one another (instead of seeing them as separate entities designed to serve different purposes) we discouraged bot development.\\nyou might remember a similar war cry when apps first came onto the scene ten years ago: but do you remember when apps replaced the internet?\\nit’s said that a new product or service needs to be two of the following: better, cheaper, or faster. are chatbots cheaper or faster than apps? no — not yet, at least.\\nwhether they’re ‘better’ is subjective, but i think it’s fair to say that today’s best bot isn’t comparable to today’s best app.\\nplus, nobody thinks that using lyft is too complicated, or that it’s too hard to order food or buy a dress on an app. what is too complicated is trying to complete these tasks with a bot — and having the bot fail.\\na great bot can be about as useful as an average app. when it comes to rich, sophisticated, multi-layered apps, there’s no competition.\\nthat’s because machines let us access vast and complex information systems, and the early graphical information systems were a revolutionary leap forward in helping us locate those systems.\\nmodern-day apps benefit from decades of research and experimentation. why would we throw this away?\\nbut, if we swap the word ‘replace’ with ‘extend’, things get much more interesting.\\ntoday’s most successful bot experiences take a hybrid approach, incorporating chat into a broader strategy that encompasses more traditional elements.\\nthe next wave will be multimodal apps, where you can say what you want (like with siri) and get back information as a map, text, or even a spoken response.\\nanother problematic aspect of the sweeping nature of hype is that it tends to bypass essential questions like these.\\nfor plenty of companies, bots just aren’t the right solution. the past two years are littered with cases of bots being blindly applied to problems where they aren’t needed.\\nbuilding a bot for the sake of it, letting it loose and hoping for the best will never end well:\\nthe vast majority of bots are built using decision-tree logic, where the bot’s canned response relies on spotting specific keywords in the user input.\\nthe advantage of this approach is that it’s pretty easy to list all the cases that they are designed to cover. and that’s precisely their disadvantage, too.\\nthat’s because these bots are purely a reflection of the capability, fastidiousness and patience of the person who created them; and how many user needs and inputs they were able to anticipate.\\nproblems arise when life refuses to fit into those boxes.\\naccording to recent reports, 70% of the 100,000+ bots on facebook messenger are failing to fulfil simple user requests. this is partly a result of developers failing to narrow their bot down to one strong area of focus.\\nwhen we were building growthbot, we decided to make it specific to sales and marketers: not an ‘all-rounder’, despite the temptation to get overexcited about potential capabilties.\\nremember: a bot that does one thing well is infinitely more helpful than a bot that does multiple things poorly.\\na competent developer can build a basic bot in minutes — but one that can hold a conversation? that’s another story. despite the constant hype around ai, we’re still a long way from achieving anything remotely human-like.\\nin an ideal world, the technology known as nlp (natural language processing) should allow a chatbot to understand the messages it receives. but nlp is only just emerging from research labs and is very much in its infancy.\\nsome platforms provide a bit of nlp, but even the best is at toddler-level capacity (for example, think about siri understanding your words, but not their meaning.)\\nas matt asay outlines, this results in another issue: failure to capture the attention and creativity of developers.\\nand conversations are complex. they’re not linear. topics spin around each other, take random turns, restart or abruptly finish.\\ntoday’s rule-based dialogue systems are too brittle to deal with this kind of unpredictability, and statistical approaches using machine learning are just as limited. the level of ai required for human-like conversation just isn’t available yet.\\nand in the meantime, there are few high-quality examples of trailblazing bots to lead the way. as dave feldman remarked:\\nonce upon a time, the only way to interact with computers was by typing arcane commands to the terminal. visual interfaces using windows, icons or a mouse were a revolution in how we manipulate information\\nthere’s a reasons computing moved from text-based to graphical user interfaces (guis). on the input side, it’s easier and faster to click than it is to type.\\ntapping or selecting is obviously preferable to typing out a whole sentence, even with predictive (often error-prone ) text. on the output side, the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words is usually true.\\nwe love optical displays of information because we are highly visual creatures. it’s no accident that kids love touch screens. the pioneers who dreamt up graphical interface were inspired by cognitive psychology, the study of how the brain deals with communication.\\nconversational uis are meant to replicate the way humans prefer to communicate, but they end up requiring extra cognitive effort. essentially, we’re swapping something simple for a more-complex alternative.\\nsure, there are some concepts that we can only express using language (“show me all the ways of getting to a museum that give me 2000 steps but don’t take longer than 35 minutes”), but most tasks can be carried out more efficiently and intuitively with guis than with a conversational ui.\\naiming for a human dimension in business interactions makes sense.\\nif there’s one thing that’s broken about sales and marketing, it’s the lack of humanity: brands hide behind ticket numbers, feedback forms, do-not-reply-emails, automated responses and gated ‘contact us’ forms.\\nfacebook’s goal is that their bots should pass the so-called turing test, meaning you can’t tell whether you are talking to a bot or a human. but a bot isn’t the same as a human. it never will be.\\na conversation encompasses so much more than just text.\\nhumans can read between the lines, leverage contextual information and understand double layers like sarcasm. bots quickly forget what they’re talking about, meaning it’s a bit like conversing with someone who has little or no short-term memory.\\nas hubspot team pinpointed:\\npeople aren’t easily fooled, and pretending a bot is a human is guaranteed to diminish returns (not to mention the fact that you’re lying to your users).\\nand even those rare bots that are powered by state-of-the-art nlp, and excel at processing and producing content, will fall short in comparison.\\nand here’s the other thing. conversational uis are built to replicate the way humans prefer to communicate — with other humans.\\nbut is that how humans prefer to interact with machines?\\nnot necessarily.\\nat the end of the day, no amount of witty quips or human-like mannerisms will save a bot from conversational failure.\\nin a way, those early-adopters weren’t entirely wrong.\\npeople are yelling at google home to play their favorite song, ordering pizza from the domino’s bot and getting makeup tips from sephora. but in terms of consumer response and developer involvement, chatbots haven’t lived up to the hype generated circa 2015/16.\\nnot even close.\\ncomputers are good at being computers. searching for data, crunching numbers, analyzing opinions and condensing that information.\\ncomputers aren’t good at understanding human emotion. the state of nlp means they still don’t ‘get’ what we’re asking them, never mind how we feel.\\nthat’s why it’s still impossible to imagine effective customer support, sales or marketing without the essential human touch: empathy and emotional intelligence.\\nfor now, bots can continue to help us with automated, repetitive, low-level tasks and queries; as cogs in a larger, more complex system. and we did them, and ourselves, a disservice by expecting so much, so soon.\\nbut that’s not the whole story.\\nyes, our industry massively overestimated the initial impact chatbots would have.

feature engineering mean building additional feature existing data often spread across multiple related tables feature engineering requires extracting relevant information data getting single table

framework recent year made possible implement convolution layer deep learning model extremely simple task often achievable single line code however understanding convolutions especially first time often feel bit unnerving term like kernels filters channel stacked onto other yet convolution concept fascinatingly powerful highly extensible post break mechanic convolution operation stepbystep relate standard fully connected network explore build strong visual hierarchy making powerful feature extractor images  convolution fairly simple operation heart start kernel simply small matrix weights kernel “slides”  input data performing elementwise multiplication part input currently on summing result single output pixel kernel repeat process every location slide over converting  matrix feature yet another  matrix features output feature essentially weighted sum with weight value kernel itself input feature located roughly location output pixel input layer whether input feature fall within “roughly location” get determined directly whether area kernel produced output not mean size kernel directly determines many or few input feature get combined production new output feature pretty stark contrast fully connected layer example × input features × output features standard fully connected layer would weight matrix ×   parameters every output feature weighted sum every single input feature convolution allow u transformation  parameters output feature instead “looking at” every input feature getting “look” input feature coming roughly location take note this critical later discussion move on definitely worth looking two technique commonplace convolution layers padding strides padding something pretty clever solve this pad edge extra “fake” pixel usually value  hence oftused term “zero padding” way kernel sliding allow original edge pixel center extending fake pixel beyond edge producing output size input idea stride skip slide location kernel stride  mean pick slide pixel apart basically every single slide acting standard convolution stride  mean picking slide  pixel apart skipping every slide process downsizing roughly factor  stride  mean skipping every

image single input channel practicality input image  channels number increase deeper go network pretty easy think channels general “view” image whole emphasising aspects deemphasising others key distinction term come handy whereas  channel case term filter kernel interchangeable general case actually pretty different filter actually happens collection kernels one kernel every single input channel layer kernel unique filter convolution layer produce one one output channel like so kernel filter “slides” respective input channels producing processed version each kernel may stronger weight others give emphasis certain input channel others eg filter may red kernel channel stronger weight others hence respond difference red channel feature others perchannel processed version summed together form one channel kernel filter produce one version channel filter whole produce one overall output channel finally bias term way bias term work output filter one bias term bias get added output channel far produce final output channel single filter case down case number filter identical filter process input own different set kernel scalar bias process described above producing single output channel concatenated together produce overall output number output channel number filters nonlinearity usually applied passing input another convolution layer repeat process even mechanic convolution layer down still hard relate back standard feedforward network still explain convolution scale to work much better image data suppose × input want transform × grid using feedforward network would reshape × input vector length  pas densely connected layer  input  outputs one could visualize weight matrix w layer although convolution kernel operation may seem bit strange first still linear transformation equivalent transformation matrix use kernel k size  reshaped × input get × output equivalent transformation matrix would be note matrix equivalent transformation matrix actual operation usually implemented different matrix  convolution then whole still linear transformation time also dramatically different kind transformation matrix  elements  parameter reused several times output node get see select number input the one inside kernel interaction inputs weight set  useful see convolution operation hard prior weight matrix context prior mean predefined

want most found give u reason believe parameter first two exactly parameter latter two four could consistent order still valid pixel however always appear consistent order nearby pixel influence pixel eg nearby pixel red pretty likely pixel also red deviations interesting anomaly could converted feature detected comparing pixel neighbors pixel locality idea really lot earlier computer vision feature extraction method based around instance edge detection one use sobel edge detection filter kernel fixed parameters operating like standard onechannel convolution nonedge containing grid eg background sky pixel value overall output kernel point  grid vertical edge difference pixel left right edge kernel computes difference nonzero activating revealing edges kernel work × grid time detecting anomaly local scale yet applied across entire image enough detect certain feature global scale anywhere image key difference make deep learning ask question useful kernel learnt early layer

yet unknown many information theory seen sophisticated amalgamation basic building block deep learning calculus probability statistics example concept ai come information theory related fields early  century scientist engineer struggling question “how quantify information analytical way mathematical measure tell u information content” example consider two sentences difficult tell second sentence give u information since also tell bruno “big” “brown” addition “dog” quantify difference two sentences mathematical measure tell u much information second sentence compared first scientist struggling questions semantics domain form data added complexity problem then mathematician engineer claude shannon came idea “entropy” changed world forever marked beginning “digital information age” shannon proposed “semantic aspect data irrelevant” nature meaning data matter come information content instead quantified information term probability distribution “uncertainty” shannon also introduced term “bit” humbly credited colleague john tukey revolutionary idea laid foundation information theory also opened new avenue progress field like artificial intelligence discus four popular widely used must known information theoretic concept deep learning data sciences also called information entropy shannon entropy entropy give measure uncertainty experiment let u consider two experiments compare two experiments exp  easier predict outcome compared exp  so say exp  inherently uncertainunpredictable exp  uncertainty experiment measured using entropy therefore inherent uncertainty experiment higher entropy lesser experiment predictable entropy probability distribution experiment used calculate entropy deterministic experiment completely predictable say tossing coin  entropy zero experiment completely random say rolling fair dice least predictable maximum uncertainty highest entropy among experiments another way look entropy average information gained observe outcome random experiment information gained outcome experiment defined function probability occurrence outcome rarer outcome information gained observing it example deterministic experiment always know outcome new information gained observing outcome hence entropy zero discrete random variable x possible outcome states  entropy unit bits defined as pxi probability ith outcome x cross entropy used compare two probability distributions tell u similar two distribution are cross entropy two probability distribution p q defined set outcome given by mutual information measure mutual dependency two probability distribution random variables tell u much information one variable carried another variable mutual information capture dependency random variable generalized vanilla correlation coefficient capture linear relationship mutual information two discrete random variable x defined as pxy joint probability distribution x y px py marginal probability distribution x respectively also called relative entropy kl divergence another measure find similarity two probability distributions measure much one distribution diverges other suppose data true distribution underlying ‘p’ know ‘p’ choose new distribution ‘q’ approximate data since ‘q’ approximation able approximate data good ‘p’ information loss occur information loss given kl divergence kl divergence ‘p’ ‘q’ tell u much information lose try approximate

interviewing someone believe would knowledge before could avoided many mistake prepared much better manner motivation behind post is able help someone bag dream place work post arose discussion one junior lack really fulfilling job opportunity offered campus placement people working ai also preparing noticed people using lot resource per experience past months realised one away minimal one role ai going mention end post begin get noticed aka interview provide list company startups apply followed ace interview based whatever experience had add section strive work for conclude minimal resource need preparation note people sitting campus placements two thing would like add firstly going say except last one maybe going relevant placements but second point mentioned before opportunity campus mostly software engineering role intersection ai so post specifically meant people want work solving interesting problem using ai also want add cleared interview guess essence failure — greatest teacher thing mention may useful thing way know might ended making case stronger honest step important one make offcampus placement tough exhausting getting recruiter actually go profile among plethora application get contact inside organisation place referral would make quite easy but general part subdivided three key steps a regulatory preparation well so regulatory preparation mean —a linkedin profile github profile portfolio website wellpolished cv firstly cv really neat concise follow guide udacity cleaning cv — resume revamp everything intend say using reference guide myself cv template inbuilt format overleaf quite nice personally use deedyresume preview seen lot content fit one page however really need that format linked would work directly instead find modified multipage format here next important thing mention github profile lot people underestimate potential this unlike linkedin “who viewed profile” option people go github way validate mentioned cv given lot noise today people associating kind buzzword profile especially data science opensource big role play majority tools implementation various algorithms list learning resources opensourced discus benefit getting involved opensource one start scratch earlier post here bare minimum be • create github account already one• create repository project done• add documentation clear instruction run code• add documentation file mentioning role function meaning parameter proper formatting eg  python along script automate previous step optional moving on third step people lack portfolio website demonstrating experience personal projects making portfolio indicates really serious getting field add lot point authenticity factor also generally space constraint cv tend miss lot details use portfolio really delve deep detail want highly recommended include sort visualisation demonstration projectidea really easy create one lot free platform draganddrop feature making process really painless personally use weebly widely used tool better reference begin with lot awesome one referred deshraj yadav’s personal website begin making mine finally lot recruiter startups nowadays started using linkedin goto platform hiring lot good job get posted there apart recruiters people working influential position quite active well so grab attention good chance getting too apart that maintaining clean profile necessary people connect you important part linkedin search tool show up must relevant keywords interspersed profile took lot iteration reevaluations finally decent one also definitely ask people worked endorse skill add recommendation talking experience working you increase chance actually getting noticed point towards udacity’s guide linkedin github profiles might seem like lot remember need single day even week month process never ends setting everything first would definitely take effort keep updating regularly event around keep happening find quite easy also able talk anywhere anytime without explicitly prepare become aware yourself b stay authentic seen lot people mistake presenting per different job profiles according me always better first decide actually interest you would happy search relevant opportunities way round fact demand ai talent surpasses supply give opportunity spending time regulatory preparation mentioned would give allaround perspective help make decision easier also need prepare answer various kind question get asked interview would come naturally would talking something really care about c networking done a figured b networking actually help get there talk people miss hearing many opportunity might good shot at important keep connecting new people day physically linkedin upon compounding many days large strong network networking messaging people place referral you starting off mistake way often stumbled upon excellent article mark meloon talk importance building real connection people offering help first another important step networking get content out example good something blog share blog facebook linkedin help others help well good enough network visibility increase multifold never know one person network liking commenting posts may help reach much broader audience including people might looking someone expertise presenting list alphabetical order avoid misinterpretation specific preference however place “” one would personally recommend recommendation based either following mission statement people personal interaction scope learning  “” purely based   factors interview begin moment entered room lot thing happen moment time asked introduce — body language fact smiling greeting play big role especially interviewing startup culturefit something extremely care about need understand much interviewer stranger you stranger himher too so probably nervous are important view interview conversation interviewer looking mutual fit — looking awesome place work interviewer looking awesome person like you work with so make sure feeling good take charge making initial moment conversation pleasant them easiest way know make happen smile mostly two type interview — one interviewer come come prepared set question going ask irrespective profile second interview based cv start second one kind interview generally begin “can tell bit yourself” point  thing big — talking gpa college talking project detail ideal statement minute two long give good idea till now restricted academics talk hobby like reading books playing sports meditation etc — basically anything contributes defining you interviewer take something talk cue next question technical part interview begins motive kind interview really check whether whatever written cv true not would lot question could done differently “x” used instead “y” would happened point important know kind tradeoff usually made implementation eg interviewer say using complex model would given better results might say actually le data work would lead overfitting one interviews given casestudy work involved designing algorithm realworld use case noticed given green flag talk project interviewer really like talk following flow problem    previous approach  approach  result  intuition kind interview really test basic knowledge expect question hard would definitely scratch every bit basic having mainly based around linear algebra probability statistics optimisation machine learning andor deep learning resource mentioned minimal resource need preparation section suffice make sure miss one bit among them catch amount time take answer questions since cover basics expect answering almost instantly so preparation accordingly throughout process important confident honest know know question certain idea about say upfront rather making “aah” “um” sounds concept really important struggling answering it interviewer would generally depending initial parts happy give hint guide towards right solution big plus manage pick hint arrive correct solution try get nervous best way avoid by again smiling come conclusion interview interviewer would ask question them really easy think interview done say nothing ask know many people got rejected failing last question mentioned before interviewed also looking mutual fit company itself so quite obvious really want join place must many question regarding work culture kind role seeing in simple curious person interviewing you always something learn everything around make sure leave interviewer impression truly interested part team final question started asking interviewers feedback might want improve on helped tremendously still remember every feedback gotten incorporated daily life it based experience honest yourself competent truly care company interviewing right mindset ticked

interested etc goal strong ai research able replicate ability computers current machine learning algorithm good yet — work focused specific limited problem maybe better definition “learning” case “figuring equation solve specific problem based example data” unfortunately “machine figuring equation solve specific problem based example data” really great name ended “machine learning” instead course reading  year future figured algorithm strong ai whole post seem little quaint maybe stop reading go tell robot servant go make sandwich future human so would write program estimate value house like example above think second read further know anything machine learning would probably try write basic rule estimating price house like this fiddle hour hours might end something sort works program never perfect hard maintain price change would better computer could figure implement function you care exactly function long return correct number one way think problem price delicious stew ingredient number bedrooms square footage neighborhood could figure much ingredient impact final price maybe exact ratio ingredient stir make final price would reduce original function with crazy if’s else’s something really simple like this notice magic number bold —     weights could figure perfect weight use work every house function could predict house prices dumb way figure best weight would something like this start weight set  run every house know function see far function guessing correct price house example first house really sold  function guessed sold   single house add squared amount house data set let u say  home sale data set square much function house grand total  “wrong” function currently is now take sum total divide  get average far house call average error amount cost function could get cost zero playing weights function would perfect would mean every case function perfectly guessed price house based input data goal — get cost low possible trying different weights repeat step  every single possible combination weights whichever combination weight make cost closest zero use find weight work solved problem pretty simple right well think did took data fed three generic really simple steps ended function guess price house area watch out zillow fact blow mind pretty crazy right ok course cannot try every combination possible weight find combo work best would literally take forever since would never run number try avoid that mathematician figured lot clever way quickly find good value weight without try many one way first write simple equation represents step  above let u rewrite exactly equation using bunch machine learning math jargon that ignore now equation represents wrong price estimating function weight currently set graph cost equation possible value weight numberofbedrooms sqft would get graph might look something like this graph lowest point blue cost lowest — thus function least wrong highest point wrong find weight get u lowest point graph answer need adjust weight “walking hill” graph towards lowest point keep making small adjustment weight always moving towards lowest point eventually get without try many different weights remember anything calculus might remember take derivative function tell slope function’s tangent point words tell u way downhill given point graph use knowledge walk downhill calculate partial derivative cost function respect weights subtract value weight walk u one step closer bottom hill keep eventually reach bottom hill best possible value weights if make sense worry keep reading high level summary one way find best weight function called batch gradient descent afraid dig deeper interested learning details use machine learning library solve real problem done you still useful good idea happening threestep algorithm described called multivariate linear regression estimating equation line fit house data points using equation guess sale price house never seen based house would appear line really powerful idea solve “real” problem it approach showed might work simple cases work cases one reason house price always simple enough follow continuous line luckily lot way handle that plenty machine learning algorithm handle nonlinear data like neural network svms kernels also way use linear regression cleverly allow complicated line fit cases basic idea needing find best weight still applies also ignored idea overfitting easy come set weight always work perfectly predicting price house original data set never actually work new house original data set way deal like regularization using crossvalidation data set learning deal issue key part learning apply machine learning successfully words basic concept pretty simple take skill experience apply machine learning get useful results skill developer learn start seeing easily machine learning technique applied problem seem really hard like handwriting recognition start get feeling could use machine learning solve problem get answer long enough data feed data watch computer magically figure equation fit data important remember machine learning work problem actually solvable data have example build model predicts home price based type potted plant house never going work kind relationship potted plant house home’s sale price matter hard tries computer never deduce relationship two remember

simple script take single image file predicts bird not really see effective network is need test lot images data set created held back  image validation ran  image network predicted correct answer  time seems pretty good right well depends network claim  accurate devil details could mean sort different things example  training image bird  birds program guessed “not bird” every single time would  accurate would also  useless need look closely number overall accuracy judge good classification system really is need look closely failed percentage time failed instead thinking prediction “right” “wrong” let u break four separate category — using validation set  images many time prediction fell category break result like this mistake created equal imagine writing program detect cancer mri image detecting cancer would rather false positive false negatives false negative would worse possible case — program told someone definitely cancer actually did instead looking overall accuracy calculate precision recall metrics precision recall metric give u clearer picture well did tell u  time guessed “bird” right also tell u found  actual bird data set words might find every bird pretty

different purpose — finding area image want pas next step pipeline face detection went mainstream early  paul viola michael jones invented way detect face fast enough run cheap cameras however much reliable solution exist now going use method invented  called histogram oriented gradient — hog short find face image start making image black white need color data find faces look every single pixel image one time every single pixel want look pixel directly surrounding it goal figure dark current pixel compared pixel directly surrounding it want draw arrow showing direction image getting darker repeat process every single pixel image end every pixel replaced arrow arrow called gradient show flow light dark across entire image might seem like random thing do really good reason replacing pixel gradients analyze pixel directly really dark image really light image person totally different pixel values considering direction brightness changes really dark image really bright image end exact representation make problem lot easier solve saving gradient every single pixel give u way much detail end missing forest trees would better could see basic flow lightnessdarkness higher level could see basic pattern image this break image small square  pixel each square count many gradient point major direction how many point up point upright point right etc replace square image arrow direction

这一阵为了工作上的关系花了点时间学习了一下lda算法说实话对于我这个学cs而非学数学的人来说除了集体智慧编程这本书之外基本没怎么看过机器学习的人来说一开始还真是摸不太到门道前前后后快要四个月了算是基本了解了这个算法的实现记录一下也供后来人快速入门做个参考。 一开始直接就下了blei的原始的那篇论文来看但是看了个开头就被dirichlet分布和几个数学公式打倒然后因为专心在写项目中的具体的代码也就先放下了。但是因为发现完全忘记了本科学的概率和统计的内容只好回头去看大学时候概率论的教材发现早不知道借给谁了于是上网买了本花了几天时间大致回顾了一遍概率论的知识什么贝叶斯全概率公式正态分布二项分布之类的。后来晚上没事儿的时候去水木的ai版转了转了解到了machine learning的圣经prml考虑到反正也是要长期学习了搞了电子版同时上淘宝买了个打印胶装的版本。春节里每天晚上看一点儿扫了一下前两章再次回顾了一下基本数学知识然后了解了下贝叶斯学派那种采用共轭先验来建模的方式。于是再次尝试回头去看blei的那篇论文发现还是看不太懂于是又放下了。然后某天tony让我准备准备给复旦的同学们share一下我们项目中lda的使用为了不露怯又去翻论文正好看到science上这篇topic model vs unstructured data的科普性质的文章翻了一遍之后再去prml里看了一遍graphic models那一张觉得对于lda想解决的问题和方法了解了更清楚了。之后从search engine里搜到这篇文章然后根据推荐读了一部分的gibbs sampling uninitiated。之后忘了怎么又搜到了mark steyvers和tom griffiths合著的probabilistic topic models在某个周末往返北京的飞机上读完了觉得基本上模型训练过程也明白了。再之后就是读了一下这个最简版的lda gibbs sampling的实现再回过头读了一下plda的源码基本上算是对lda有了个相对清楚的了解。 这样前前后后也过去了三个月其实不少时间都是浪费掉的比如blei的论文在没有任何相关知识的情况下一开始读了好几次都没读完而且得到到信息也很有限如果重新总结一下我觉得对于我们这些门外汉程序员来说想了解lda大概需要这些知识 基本上这样一圈下来基本概念和算法实现都应该搞定了当然数学证明其实没那么容易就搞定但是对于工程师来说先把这些搞定就能干活了这个步骤并不适合各位读博士发论文的同学们但是这样先看看也比较容易对于这些数学问题的兴趣不然成天对这符号和数学公式没有整块业余时间的我是觉得还是容易退缩放弃的。 发现作为工程师来说还是看代码比较有感觉看实际应用的实例比较有感觉看来不能把大部分时间花在prml上还是要多对照着代码看。

answer right supervised learning letting computer work relationship you know math required solve specific set problems could answer problem type let u go back original example real estate agent know sale price house even know size location etc house turn still really cool stuff called unsupervised learning kind like someone giving list number sheet paper saying “i really know number mean maybe figure pattern grouping something — good luck” could data starters could algorithm automatically identified different market segment data maybe would find home buyer neighborhood near local college really like small house lot bedrooms home buyer suburb prefer  house lot square footage knowing different kind customer could help direct marketing efforts another cool thing could automatically identify outlier house way different everything else maybe outlier house giant mansion focus best sale people area bigger commissions supervised learning focus rest post unsupervised learning le useful interesting fact unsupervised learning becoming increasingly important algorithm get better used without label data correct answer side note lot type machine learning algorithms pretty good place start human brain approach situation learn deal situation without explicit instructions sell house long time instinctively “feel” right price house best way market house kind client would interested etc goal strong ai research able replicate ability computers current machine learning algorithm good yet — work focused specific limited problem maybe better definition “learning” case “figuring equation solve specific problem based example data” unfortunately “machine figuring equation solve specific problem based example data” really great name ended “machine learning” instead course reading  year future figured algorithm strong ai whole post seem little quaint maybe stop reading go tell robot servant go make sandwich future human so would write program estimate value house like example above think second read further know anything machine learning would probably try write basic rule estimating price house like this fiddle hour hours might end something sort works program never perfect hard maintain price change would better computer could figure implement function you care exactly function long return correct number one way think problem price delicious stew ingredient number bedrooms square footage neighborhood could figure much ingredient impact final price maybe exact ratio ingredient stir make final price would reduce original function with crazy if’s else’s something really simple like this notice magic number bold —     weights could figure perfect weight use work every house function could predict house prices dumb way figure best weight would something like this start weight set  run every house know function see far function guessing correct price house example first house really sold  function guessed sold   single house add squared amount house data set let u say  home sale data set square much function house grand total  “wrong” function currently is now take sum total divide  get average far house call average error amount cost function could get cost zero playing weights function would perfect would mean every case function perfectly guessed price house based input data goal — get cost low possible trying different weights repeat step  every single possible combination weights whichever combination weight make cost closest zero use find weight work solved problem pretty simple right well think did took data fed three generic really simple steps ended function guess price house area watch out zillow fact blow mind pretty crazy right ok course cannot try every combination possible weight find combo work best would literally take forever since would never run number try avoid that mathematician figured lot clever way quickly find good value weight without try many one way first write simple equation represents step  above let u rewrite exactly equation using bunch machine learning math jargon that ignore now equation represents wrong price estimating function weight currently set graph cost equation possible value weight numberofbedrooms sqft would get graph might look something like this graph lowest point blue cost lowest — thus function least wrong highest point wrong find weight get u lowest point graph answer need adjust weight “walking hill” graph towards lowest point keep making small adjustment weight always moving towards lowest point eventually get without try many different weights remember anything calculus might remember take derivative function tell slope function’s tangent point words tell u way downhill given point graph use knowledge walk downhill calculate partial derivative cost function respect weights subtract value weight walk u one step closer bottom hill keep eventually reach bottom hill best possible value weights if make sense worry keep reading high level summary one way find best weight function called batch gradient descent afraid dig deeper interested learning details use machine learning library solve real problem done you still useful good idea happening threestep algorithm described called multivariate linear regression estimating equation line fit house data points using equation guess sale price house never seen based house would appear line really powerful idea solve “real” problem it approach showed might work simple cases work cases one reason house price always simple enough follow continuous line luckily lot way handle that plenty machine learning algorithm handle nonlinear data like neural network svms kernels also way use linear regression cleverly allow complicated line fit cases basic idea needing find best weight still applies also ignored idea overfitting easy come set weight always work perfectly predicting price house original data set never actually work new house original data set way

like “chicken” “pepper” “salt” “cheese” also contains word like “use” “buy” “definitely” “my” “the”  model give u vector word one could naively sum every word vector doc vector clearly introduces lot noise better heuristic use weighted sum based information like idf part speech pos tag question is could selective adding terms chicken recipe document even consider word like “definitely” “use” “my” summation one argue idf based weight significantly reduce noise boring word like “the” “is” however word like “definitely” “overwhelming” idf necessarily small would hope natural think first group

either r python certainly language tool used two unquestionably top list since trying develop python skills decided start working exercise scratch python full source code available ipython repo github also find data used exercise original exercise pdfs subfolders root directory interested explain concept involved exercise along way impossible convey information might need fully comprehend it really interested machine learning exposed yet encourage check class it completely free commitment whatsoever that let u get started first part exercise  tasked implementing simple linear regression predict profit food truck suppose ceo restaurant franchise considering different city opening new outlet chain already truck various city data profit population cities would like figure expected profit new food truck might given population city would placed in let u start examining data file called “” “data” directory repository above first need import libraries let u get thing rolling use panda load data data frame display first row using “head” function note medium cannot render table — full example here another useful function panda provides outofthebox “describe” function calculates basic statistic data set helpful get “feel” data exploratory analysis stage project note medium cannot render table — full example here examining stats data helpful sometimes need find way visualize too fortunately data set one dependent variable toss scatter plot get better idea look like use “plot” function provided panda this really wrapper matplotlib really help actually look going on it clearly see cluster value around city smaller populations somewhat linear trend increasing profit size city increases let u get fun part — implementing linear regression algorithm python scratch familiar linear regression approach modeling relationship dependent variable one independent variable if one independent variable called simple linear regression one independent variable called multiple linear regression lot different type variance linear regression outside scope discussion go here put simply — trying create linear model data x using number parameter theta describes variance data given new data point x could accurately predict outcome would without actually knowing is implementation going use optimization technique called gradient descent find parameter theta familiar linear algebra may aware another way find optimal parameter linear model called “normal equation” basically solves problem using series matrix calculations however issue approach scale well large data sets contrast use variant gradient descent optimization method scale data set unlimited size machine learning problem approach practical okay enough theory let u write code first thing need cost function cost function evaluates quality model calculating error model’s prediction data point using model parameters actual data point example population given city  predicted  error –     assuming  “least squares” loss function data point x sum result get cost function notice loops taking advantage numpy’s linear algrebra capability compute result series matrix operations far computationally efficient unoptimizted “for” loop order make cost function work seamlessly panda data frame created above need manipulating first need insert column  beginning data frame order make matrix operation work correctly i go detail needed exercise text interested — basically account intercept term linear equation second need separate data independent variable x dependent variable y finally going convert data frame numpy matrix instantiate parameter matirx one useful trick remember debugging matrix operation look shape matrix dealing with also helpful remember walking step head matrix multiplication look like i x j  j x k  i x k i j k shape relative dimension matrix       okay try cost function remember parameter initialized  solution optimal yet see works  far good need define function perform gradient descent parameter theta using update rule defined exercise text function gradient descent idea gradient descent iteration compute gradient error term order figure appropriate direction move parameter vector words calculating change make parameter order reduce error thus bringing solution closer optimal solution ie best fit fairly complex topic could easily devote whole blog post discussing gradient descent interested learning more would recommend starting article branching there relying numpy linear algebra solution may notice implementation  optimal particular way get rid inner loop update parameter once leave reader figure i cover later post got way evaluate solutions way find good solution time apply data set    note initialized new variable here look closely gradient descent function parameter called alpha iters alpha learning rate — factor update rule parameter help determine quickly algorithm converge optimal solution iters number iterations hard fast rule initialize parameter typically trialanderror involved parameter vector descibing believe optimal linear model data set one quick way evaluate good regression model might look total error new solution data set  certainly lot better  intuitive way look it fortunately technique disposal going use matplotlib visualize solution remember scatter plot before let u overlay line representing model top scatter plot data see well fits use numpy’s “linspace” function create evenlyspaced series point within range data “evaluate” point using model see expected profit would be turn line graph plot it bad solution look like optimal linear model data set since gradient decent function also output vector cost training iteration plot well notice cost always decrease — example called convex optimization problem plot entire solution space problem ie plot cost function model parameter every possible value parameters would see look like “bowl” shape “basin” representing optimal solution now part  finish first exercise

datascience machinelearning frenchdata kaggle machine learning จริงๆแล้วมันคืออะไรกันแน่ ครั้งแรกที่ผมได้ยินคําคํานี้ ผมก็พูดกับตัวเองในใจ “เครื่องจักรที่เรียนรู้ได้ด้วยตัวเองงั้นเหรอ” ใครมาถามว่ารู้จัก machine learning หรือเปล่า มันคืออะไรอะ ผมก็ได้แต่บอกเขาไปว่า “เคยได้ยินแต่ชื่อว่ะ” ผมหวังเป็นอย่างยิ่งว่า คุณที่หลงเข้ามาอ่านบทความนี้ ที่อาจจะเป็นเหมือนผมที่เคยได้ยินมาแต่ชื่อ เมื่ออ่านจบ หากมีใครมาถามว่า “รู้จัก machine learning หรือเปล่า มันคืออะไรอะ” จะมีความมั่นใจมากพอที่จะตอบเขาไปว่า “รู้ดิ นั่งๆ เดี๋ยวเล่าให้ฟัง” ก่อนที่จะอธิบายว่า machine learning คืออะไร ขอโม้สักเล็กน้อย ให้เห็นความสําคัญของมันเสียก่อน แล้วจะพบว่า machine learning นี่แทบจะเป็นส่วนหนึ่งของชีวิตประจําวันไปแล้ว machine learning เป็นเรื่องที่ใกล้ตัวเรามากๆ ยิ่งสําหรับคนที่ใช้ internet เป็นประจํานั้น แทบทุกวันจะได้ใช้ประโยชน์จาก machine learning ไม่ว่าจะรู้ตัวหรือไม่ก็ตาม ยกตัวอย่างเช่น เมื่อเราต้องการค้นหาอะไรบางอย่างด้วย google search แต่ไม่ค่อยแน่ใจ คับคล้ายคับคลาว่ามันน่าจะสะกดแบบนี้ “machn leaning” ตัวอย่างโง่นิดนึง  ปรากฏว่า โอ้ พระสงฆ์ มันเดาใจเราได้ เป็นหมอดูหรืออย่างไร แน่นอนว่าโค้ดก็คงจะไม่ใช่แบบด้านล่างนี้แน่ๆ แล้วทําไม google ถึงได้รู้ใจเรากันนะ ยังมีตัวอย่างอีกมากมายที่นํา machine learning ไปใช้ เช่น spam filtering face recognition handwriting recognition แม้แต่การทํา marketing ในปัจจุบันก็เริ่มใช้ประโยชน์ machine learning เช่นกัน อาทิ การแบ่งกลุ่มลูกค้าcustomer segmentation การทํานายการสูญเสียลูกค้าcustomer churn prediction เป็นต้น และที่จะไม่พูดถึงไม่ได้เลยคือ facebook’s friend suggestion ที่ผมเองก็ไม่รู้ว่าทําไมมันถึงแนะนําสาวสวยให้ผมอย่างสม่ําเสมอ แต่สิ่งที่ผมมั่นใจคือ facebook ไม่ได้ใช้คนมานั่งเลือกให้แน่ๆ แล้วมันทําได้ยังไงกัน แน่นอนว่า machine learning คือคําตอบ สมองของมนุษย์นั้นมีความสามารถที่น่าทึ่งมากมาย เช่น การตระหนักรู้ อารมณ์ความรู้สึก ความทรงจํา ความสามารถในการควบคุมร่างกาย รวมถึงประสาทสัมผัสทั้งห้าที่ทําให้เรามีความสามารถในการรับรู้ แต่ก็มีปัญหาบางอย่างที่ซับซ้อน และไม่เหมาะที่จะแก้ปัญหาโดยการใช้สมองของมนุษย์เพียงอย่างเดียว เมื่อต้องเขียนโปรแกรมที่จัดการกับข้อมูลจํานวนมาก และมีรูปแบบที่แตกต่างกันออกไป เป็นเรื่องยากที่เราจะทําความเข้าใจข้อมูลและเขียนโปรแกรมที่จะตอบสนองต่อมัน เมื่อมีข้อมูลเข้ามาเพิ่มและมีลักษณะที่ต่างไปอีกก็เหมือนกับ requirement เปลี่ยนตลอดเวลา เราก็ต้องวิเคราะห์ข้อมูลใหม่และแก้โปรแกรมของเราเรื่อยๆซึ่งลําบากมาก arthur samuel หนึ่งในผู้บุกเบิก computer gaming artificial intelligence และ machine learning ชาวอเมริกัน ได้นิยาม machine learning เอาไว้ว่า เป็น “การศึกษาเกี่ยวกับการทําให้คอมพิวเตอร์มีความสามารถที่จะเรียนรู้โดยที่ไม่ต้องเขียนโปรแกรมลงไปตรงๆ” กล่าวคือ machine learning นั้น ไม่ได้กําหนดลงไปในโปรแกรมว่า สําหรับลักษณะ a b ใดๆ หากข้อมูลมีลักษณะแบบ ต้องทําอย่างไร แบบ b ต้องทําอย่างไร แต่เป็นโปรแกรมที่ทําความเข้าใจความสัมพันธ์ของข้อมูล แล้วสร้างวิธีการตอบสนองต่อข้อมูลขึ้นมาเอง ในเมื่อโปรแกรมสามารถเปลี่ยนแปลงวิธีการตอบสนองต่อข้อมูลได้ด้วยตัวเอง เราจึงไม่จําเป็นต้องคอยวิเคราะห์ข้อมูลและแก้โปรแกรมทุกครั้งที่มีข้อมูลใหม่เข้ามาอีกต่อไป ตัวผมเองเคยสงสัยว่า machine learning artificial intelligence และdata mining มันต่างกันยังไง รู้สึกว่ามันก็เป็นเรื่องที่คล้ายกันมากๆ แต่แล้วผมก็พบความจริงว่า จริงๆแล้ว ทั้ง ai artificial intelligence และ data mining นั้นนํา machine learning ไปใช้ สิ่งที่ต่างกันก็คือเป้าหมาย ai นั้นโฟกัสที่การสร้าง intelligent agent หรือตัวตนที่มีความคิดขึ้นมา ซึ่งไม่จําเป็นที่จะต้องใช้ machine learning ก็ได้ ถึงแม้จะใช้เพียงแค่การ search หากสามารถตอบสนองได้อย่างชาญฉลาด ก็สามารถเรียกว่าเป็น ai ได้ แต่ไม่จําเป็น ไม่ได้แปลว่าไม่ได้นําไปใช้ ในทางกลับกัน machine learning ถูกนําไปใช้ประโยชน์ใน ai เยอะมากๆ โดยถูกใช้เพื่อที่จะสร้างความรู้ใหม่ๆ และนําไปสู่การตอบสนองต่อเหตุการณ์ที่ต่างออกไปจากที่กําหนดไว้แต่แรก ส่วน data mining นั้น เป็นขั้นตอนการวิเคราะห์ใน knowledge discovery หรือการค้นหาความรู้ โดยจะเปลี่ยนจากข้อมูลดิบdataให้เป็นข้อมูลที่ทําความเข้าใจได้information เพื่อที่จะนําไปใช้ต่อในอนาคต data mining ใช้วิธีการของทั้ง ai machine learning สถิติ และ database system ในการได้มาซึ่งข้อมูลเชิงลึก หรือ insight โดยสรุปแล้ว ทั้ง  ศาสตร์นั้นมีความเกี่ยวข้องกันอย่างมาก และต่างก็นําวิธีการของกันและกันไปใช้ จึงไม่แปลกที่จะรู้สึกว่ามันดูคล้ายๆกัน เพียงแต่เป้าหมายของมันต่างกัน ทําให้วิธีการนั้นไม่เหมือนกันซะทีเดียว machine learning algorithm นั้น โดยพื้นฐานแล้วจะแบ่งออกได้เป็น  ประเภทคือ supervised learning กับ unsupervised learning supervised learning คือ การเรียนรู้ที่ได้รับคําแนะนํา สมมติว่าเราเกิดเสียความทรงจํา ไม่สามารถแยกแยะ แอปเปิ้ล มะม่วง และส้มออกจากกันได้ คุณหมอผู้น่ารักจึงเอา แอปเปิ้ล มะม่วง และส้ม มาให้ดู ผลไม้ทั้งหมดที่คุณหมอเอามาให้ดูนี้เรียกว่า training data คือข้อมูลที่นํามาใช้ในการฝึกสอน คุณหมอเริ่มจากการนําแอปเปิ้ลหลากหลายแบบมาให้ดู และบอกว่า “นี่คือแอปเปิ้ล” นี่เป็นการให้ label หรือป้ายที่แปะบอกว่าข้อมูลที่ได้มานี้คืออะไร เมื่อเราได้เห็นแอปเปิ้ลก็จะพบว่า แอปเปิ้ลนั้นมีสีแดง หรือสีเขียว รูปทรงของแอปเปิ้ลนั้นหากผ่าครึ่งจะมีลักษณะคล้ายผีเสื้อ สิ่งเหล่านี้เรียกว่า feature หรือคุณสมบัติของข้อมูล หลังจากนั้นคุณหมอก็นํามะม่วงและส้มมาให้ดู และพบว่า มะม่วงมีสีเขียวหรือเหลือง รูปทรงค่อนข้างยาว ส่วนส้มมีสีส้ม และมีรูปทรงเป็นทรงรี เมื่อได้ข้อมูลมากเพียงพอ ก็จะเริ่มแยกแยะ แอปเปิ้ล มะม่วง และส้ม ออกจากกันได้ ต่อมา หากเจอส้มเปลือกสีเขียวก็อาจจะเดาได้ว่าเป็นส้ม เพราะรูปทรงของมัน นี่เป็นตัวอย่างหนึ่งของ classification หรือการจัดหมวดหมู่ เป็น supervised learning แบบหนึ่งที่ใช้กับข้อมูลที่ไม่ต่อเนื่อง discrete regression เป็นการวิเคราะห์สําหรับข้อมูลที่ต่อเนื่อง continuous ภาพด้านบนแสดงถึง linear regression หรือ line best fit ซึ่งเป็น regression แบบหนึ่ง จะเห็นได้ว่าเรามี training data อยู่ ซึ่งก็ไม่ได้เรียงตัวกันเป็นเส้นตรง แต่ก็พอจะเห็นรูปแบบและแนวโน้มของข้อมูล หากเราลากเส้นโดยพยายามให้ผลรวมของระยะห่างจาก training data ซึ่งเป็นความคลาดเคลื่อนน้อยที่สุด เราก็จะได้ model ที่พอจะทํานายค่า ต่อๆไปได้ george e p box นักสถิติศาสตร์กล่าวไว้ว่า อย่างที่เห็นในภาพ เส้นสีน้ําเงินนั่นคือ model หรือแบบจําลองเพื่อทํานายค่า ที่มี x สูงกว่านี้ แต่จะเห็นได้ว่าแทบไม่มีจุดไหนที่ตรงเป๊ะๆเลย เราใช้ได้แค่พอทํานายได้คร่าวๆเท่านั้น หาก supervised learning คือการเรียนรู้ที่มีคําแนะนํา unsupervised learning ก็คือการไปตายเอาดาบหน้า ไม่มีใครมาแนะนําเรา แต่คงต้องขอไปลุยซักตั้ง เมื่อ supervised learning มี classification ทางด้าน unsupervised learning ก็จะมี clustering ซึ่งหลายคนรวมถึงผมเอง เมื่อได้รู้จักครั้งแรก ก็สงสัยว่า เอ๊ะ มันต่างกันยังไง classification เป็นการจัดหมวดหมู่ ส่วน clustering เป็นการจัดกลุ่ม ฟังๆดูก็คล้ายๆกันอยู่ดี เช่นนั้นแล้ว ลองกลับไปสวมบทผู้ป่วยสูญเสียความทรงจํา กับคุณหมอน่ารักอีกสักครั้งนะครับ คราวนี้ คุณหมอ เอาผลไม้มาอีกสามชนิดที่หน้าตาไม่เหมือนทั้งแอปเปิ้ล มะม่วงและส้ม แต่คุณหมอไม่ยอมบอกอะไรเกี่ยวกับเจ้าพวกนี้เลยสักนิด หรือก็คือตอนนี้ ผลไม้เหล่านี้ไม่มี label แต่คุณหมอก็สั่งให้เราแยกมันออกมาเป็นสามกลุ่ม เมื่อเราสังเกต feature ของผลไม้พวกนี้ก็จะพอแยกแยะได้ว่าผลไม้ลูกไหนควรจะอยู่กลุ่มเดียวกัน เมื่อแยกได้สามกลุ่มแล้ว คุณหมอก็เดินจากไปเสียเฉยๆ ไม่บอกไม่กล่าวอะไร สุดท้ายเราก็รู้แค่ว่า ผลไม้แต่ละลูกอยู่กลุ่มเดียวกับใคร แต่บอกไม่ได้ว่ามันคืออะไรกันแน่ นี่คือ clustering ต่างจาก classification ที่บอกเราตั้งแต่แรกว่าผลไม้แต่ละชนิดมีชื่อว่าอะไรบ้าง หลายครั้งที่ข้อมูลนั้นมี feature หลายชนิด หรือก็คือเป็นข้อมูลที่มีมิติมาก เมื่อเป็นเช่นนั้นแล้วก็จะเป็นเรื่องยากที่จะแสดงภาพ หรือ visualize ข้อมูล เราจึงควรลดมิติของข้อมูลลง โดยพยายามคงความหมายเดิมอยู่ dimensionality reduction หรือ dimension reduction เป็นการลดมิติของข้อมูล ซึ่งนอกจากจะทําให้ง่ายที่จะ visualize แล้ว เมื่อมีมิติที่น้อยลง นั่นหมายถึงมี feature ที่น้อยลง ซึ่งทําให้ performance ดีขึ้น และลด space complexity อีกด้วย นอกจากประเภทของ machine learning algorithm แบบ basic ที่เขียนไว้ด้านบนแล้วยังมี semisupervised learning และ reinforcement learning ที่พี่ต้า konpat เขียนเอาไว้ครับ สุดท้ายนี้ ผมเชื่อว่า machine learning เป็นศาสตร์หนึ่งที่สําคัญมากๆสําหรับวงการคอมพิวเตอร์ในปัจจุบัน และอนาคต และส่วนตัวผมคิดว่าศาสตร์นี้มันเท่มากๆเลยนะ ใครสนใจใน machine learning ก็เข้ามาคุยกันได้นะครับ d quick cheer standing ovation clap show much enjoyed story software choreographer thoughtworks functional

number right neural network trying recognize speech pattern processing sample directly difficult instead make problem easier preprocessing audio data let u start grouping sampled audio  chunks first  millisecond audio ie first  samples plotting number simple line graph give u rough approximation original sound wave  millisecond period time recording  second long even short recording complex mishmash different frequency sound low sounds midrange sounds even highpitched sound sprinkled in taken together different frequency mix together make complex sound human speech make data easier neural network process going break apart complex sound wave component parts break lowpitched parts nextlowestpitchedparts on adding much energy frequency band from low high create fingerprint sort audio snippet imagine recording someone playing c major chord piano sound combination three musical notes— c e g — mixed together one complex sound want break apart complex sound individual note discover c e g exact idea using mathematic operation called fourier transform break apart complex sound wave simple sound wave make up individual sound waves add much energy contained one end result score important frequency range is low pitch ie bass notes high pitch number represents much energy  band  millisecond audio clip lot easier see draw chart repeat process every  millisecond chunk audio end spectrogram each column lefttoright one  chunk spectrogram cool actually see musical note pitch pattern audio data neural network find pattern kind data easily raw sound waves data representation actually feed neural network audio format easy process feed deep neural network input neural network  millisecond audio chunks little audio slice try figure letter corresponds sound currently spoken use recurrent neural network — is neural network memory influence future predictions letter predicts affect likelihood next letter predict too example said “hel” far likely say “lo” next finish word “hello” much le likely say something unpronounceable next like “xyz” memory previous prediction help neural network make accurate prediction going forward run entire audio clip neural network one chunk time end mapping audio chunk letter likely spoken chunk mapping look like saying “hello” neural net predicting one likely thing said “hhheelllllooo” also think possible said “hhhuulllllooo” even “aaauulllllooo” step follow clean output first replace repeated character single character remove blanks leaf u three possible transcription — “hello” “hullo” “aullo” say loud sound similar “hello” predicting one character time neural network come soundedout transcriptions example say “he would go” might give one possible transcription “he wud net go” trick combine pronunciationbased prediction likelihood score based large database written text books news articles etc throw transcription seem least likely real keep transcription seems realistic possible transcription “hello” “hullo” “aullo” obviously “hello” appear frequently database text not mention original audiobased training data thus probably correct pick “hello” final transcription instead others done might thinking “but someone say ‘hullo’ valid word maybe ‘hello’ wrong transcription” course possible someone actually said “hullo” instead “hello” speech recognition system like trained american english basically never produce “hullo” transcription unlikely thing user say compared “hello” always think saying “hello” matter much emphasize ‘you’ sound try out phone set american english try get phone’s digital assistant recognize world “hullo” cannot refuses always understand “hello” recognizing “hullo” reasonable behavior sometimes find annoying case phone refuse understand

something similar training data works first break sentence simple chunk easily translated next translate chunk finding way human translated chunk word training data important note looking chunk simple translation dictionary instead seeing actual people translated chunk word realworld sentences help u capture different way used different contexts possible translation used frequently others based frequently translation appears training data give score example much common someone say “quiero” mean “i want” mean “i try” use frequently “quiero” translated “i want” training data give translation weight le frequent translation next use every possible combination chunk generate bunch possible sentences chunk translation listed step  already generate nearly  different variation sentence combining chunk different ways examples realworld system even possible chunk combination also try different ordering word different way chunking sentence need scan generated sentence find one sound “most human” this compare generated sentence million real sentence book news story written english english text get hand on better take possible translation likely one ever written sentence like

like csi idea turning face list measurement example encoding taking raw data a picture face turning list measurement represent the encoding like saw part  come specific list facial feature measure ourselves instead use neural network generate measurement face computer better job u figuring measurement best able differentiate two similar people encoding let u u represent something complicated a picture face something simple  numbers comparing two different face much easier compare  number face instead comparing full images guess what thing sentences come encoding represents every possible different sentence series unique numbers generate encoding feed sentence rnn one word time final result last word processed value represent entire sentence great way represent entire sentence set unique numbers know number encoding means really matter long sentence uniquely identified set numbers need know exactly number generated ok know use rnn encode sentence set unique numbers help us thing get really cool took two rnns hooked endtoend first rnn could generate encoding represents sentence second rnn could take encoding logic reverse decode original sentence again course able encode decode original sentence useful and big idea could train second rnn decode sentence spanish instead english could use parallel corpus training data train that like that generic way converting sequence

enjoyed story cofounder applied data science cutting edge data science news project clustering machine learning technique involves grouping data points given set data points use clustering algorithm classify data point specific group theory data point group similar property andor features data point different group highly dissimilar property andor features clustering method unsupervised learning common technique statistical data analysis used many fields data science use clustering analysis gain valuable insight data seeing group data point fall apply clustering algorithm today going look  popular clustering algorithm data scientist need know pro cons kmeans probably well know clustering algorithm taught lot introductory data science machine learning classes easy understand implement code check graphic illustration kmeans advantage pretty fast really computing distance point group centers computations thus linear complexity on hand kmeans couple disadvantages firstly select many groupsclasses are always trivial ideally clustering algorithm would want figure u point gain insight data kmeans also start random choice cluster center therefore may yield different clustering result different run algorithm thus result may repeatable lack consistency cluster method consistent kmedians another clustering algorithm related kmeans except instead recomputing group center point using mean use median vector group method le sensitive outlier because using median much slower larger datasets sorting required iteration computing median vector mean shift clustering slidingwindowbased algorithm attempt find dense area data points centroidbased algorithm meaning goal locate center point groupclass work updating candidate center point mean point within slidingwindow candidate window filtered postprocessing stage eliminate nearduplicates forming final set center point corresponding groups check graphic illustration illustration entire process endtoend sliding window show below black dot represents centroid sliding window gray dot data point contrast kmeans clustering need select number cluster meanshift automatically discovers this massive advantage fact cluster center converge towards point maximum density also quite desirable quite intuitive understand fit well naturally datadriven sense drawback selection window sizeradius “r” nontrivial dbscan density based clustered algorithm similar meanshift couple notable advantages check another fancy graphic let u get started dbscan pose great advantage clustering algorithms firstly require peset number cluster all also identifies outlier noise unlike meanshift simply throw cluster even data point different additionally able find arbitrarily sized arbitrarily shaped cluster quite well main drawback dbscan perform well others cluster varying density setting distance threshold ε minpoints identifying neighborhood point vary cluster cluster density varies drawback also occurs highdimensional data since distance threshold ε becomes challenging estimate one major drawback kmeans naive use mean value cluster center see best way thing looking image below left hand side look quite obvious human eye two circular cluster different radius’ centered mean kmeans cannot handle mean value cluster close together kmeans also fails case cluster circular result using mean cluster center gaussian mixture model gmms give u flexibility kmeans gmms assume data point gaussian distributed le restrictive assumption saying circular using mean way two parameter describe shape clusters mean standard deviation taking example two dimensions mean cluster take kind elliptical shape since standard deviation x directions thus gaussian distribution assigned single cluster order find parameter gaussian cluster eg mean standard deviation use optimization algorithm called expectation–maximization them take look graphic illustration gaussians fitted clusters proceed process expectation–maximization clustering using gmms really  key advantage using gmms firstly gmms lot flexible term cluster covariance kmeans due standard deviation parameter cluster take ellipse shape rather restricted circles kmeans actually special case gmm cluster’s covariance along dimension approach  secondly since gmms use probabilities multiple cluster per data point data point middle two overlapping clusters simply define class saying belongs xpercent class  ypercent class  ie gmms support mixed membership hierarchical clustering algorithm actually fall  categories topdown bottomup bottomup algorithm treat data point single cluster outset successively merge or agglomerate pair cluster cluster merged single cluster contains data points bottomup hierarchical clustering therefore called hierarchical agglomerative clustering hac hierarchy cluster represented tree or dendrogram root tree unique cluster gather samples leaf cluster one sample check graphic illustration moving algorithm step hierarchical clustering require u specify number cluster even select number cluster look best since building tree additionally algorithm sensitive choice distance metric tend work equally well whereas clustering algorithms choice distance metric critical particularly good use case hierarchical clustering method underlying data hierarchical structure want recover hierarchy clustering algorithm cannot this advantage hierarchical clustering come cost lower efficiency time complexity  unlike linear complexity kmeans gmm top  clustering algorithm data scientist know end awesome visualization well algorithm others perform

problems  start slot machine let u imagine faced  chest pick turn different average payout goal maximize total payout receive fixed number turns classic problem called multiarmed bandit start crux problem balance exploration help u learn state good exploitation use know pick best slot machine here utilize value function map action estimated reward called q function first initialize q value equal values then update q value action picking chest based good payout choosing action allows u learn good value function approximate q function using neural network starting shallow one learns probability distribution by using softmax  potential chests value function tell u good estimate action be policy function determines action end taking intuitively might want use policy pick action highest q value performs poorly practice q estimate wrong start gather enough experience trial error need add mechanism policy encourage exploration one way use epsilon greedy consists taking random action probability epsilon start epsilon close  always choosing random actions lower epsilon go along learn chest good eventually learn chest best practice might want take subtle approach either taking action think best random action popular method boltzmann exploration adjust probability based current estimate good chest is adding randomness factor  different state previous example world always state waiting pick  chest front us realword problem consist many different states add environment next now background behind chest alternate  color turn changing average value chests mean need learn q function depends action the chest pick state what color background is version problem called contextual multiarmed bandits surprisingly use approach before thing need add extra dense layer neural network take input vector representing current state world  consequence action another key factor make current problem simpler mosts environments maze depicted above action take impact state world move grid might receive reward might receive nothing next turn different state finally introduce need planning first define q function immediate reward current state plus discounted reward expecting taking future actions solution work q estimate state accurate learn good estimate use method called temporal difference td learning learn good q function idea look limited number step future

propagate gradients like traditional deep learning update value estimates  monte carlo another method estimate eventual success action monte carlo estimates consists playing entire episode current

exploration strategy built policy itself allows u tie result directly reasoning enables u learn efficiently approach use called policy gradients onpolicy method previously first learning value

thus encourage u make riskier choice explore space  deep learning representation practice many state art rl method require learning policy value estimates way deep learning two separate output backbone neural network make easier neural network learn good representations one method advantage actor critic  learn policy directly policy gradient defined above learn value function using

fellow program  bridge career data advent powerful versatile deep learning framework recent year made possible implement convolution layer deep learning model extremely simple task often achievable single line code however understanding convolutions especially first time often feel bit unnerving term like kernels filters channel stacked onto other yet convolution concept fascinatingly powerful highly extensible post break mechanic convolution operation stepbystep relate standard fully connected network explore build strong visual hierarchy making powerful feature extractor images  convolution fairly simple operation heart start kernel simply small matrix weights kernel “slides”  input data performing elementwise multiplication part input currently on summing result single output pixel kernel repeat process every location slide over converting  matrix feature yet another  matrix features output feature essentially weighted sum with weight value kernel itself input feature located roughly location output pixel input layer whether input feature fall within “roughly location” get determined directly whether area kernel produced output not mean size kernel directly determines many or few input feature get combined production new output feature pretty stark contrast fully connected layer example × input features × output features standard fully connected layer would weight matrix ×   parameters every output feature weighted sum every single input feature convolution allow u transformation  parameters output feature instead “looking at” every input feature getting “look” input feature coming roughly location take note this critical later discussion move on definitely worth looking two technique commonplace convolution layers padding strides padding something pretty clever solve this pad edge extra “fake” pixel usually value  hence oftused term “zero padding” way kernel sliding allow original edge pixel center extending fake pixel beyond edge producing output size input idea stride skip slide location kernel stride  mean pick slide pixel apart basically every single slide acting standard convolution stride  mean picking slide  pixel apart skipping every slide process downsizing roughly factor  stride  mean skipping every  slides downsizing roughly factor  on modern networks resnet architecture entirely forgo pooling layer internal layers favor strided convolution needing reduce output sizes course diagram deal case image single input channel practicality input image  channels number increase deeper go network pretty easy think channels general “view” image whole emphasising aspects deemphasising others key distinction term come handy whereas  channel case term filter kernel interchangeable general case actually pretty different filter actually happens collection kernels one kernel every single input channel layer kernel unique filter convolution layer produce one one output channel like so kernel filter “slides” respective input channels producing processed version each kernel may stronger weight others give emphasis certain input channel others eg filter may red kernel channel stronger weight others hence respond difference red channel feature others perchannel processed version summed together form one channel kernel filter produce one version channel filter whole produce one overall output channel finally bias term way bias term work output filter one bias term bias get added output channel far produce final output channel single filter case down case number filter identical filter process input own different set kernel scalar bias process described above producing single output channel concatenated together produce overall output number output channel number filters nonlinearity usually applied passing input another convolution layer repeat process even mechanic convolution layer down still hard relate back standard feedforward network still explain convolution scale to work much better image data suppose × input want transform × grid using feedforward network would reshape × input vector length  pas densely connected layer  input  outputs one could visualize weight matrix w layer although convolution kernel operation may seem bit strange first still linear transformation equivalent transformation matrix use kernel k size  reshaped × input get × output equivalent transformation matrix would be note matrix equivalent transformation matrix actual operation usually implemented different matrix  convolution then whole still linear transformation time also dramatically different kind transformation matrix  elements  parameter reused several times output node get see select number input the one inside kernel interaction inputs weight set  useful see convolution operation hard prior weight matrix context prior mean predefined network parameters example use pretrained model image classification use pretrained network parameter prior feature extractor final densely connected layer sense direct intuition efficient compared alternatives transfer learning efficient order magnitude compared random initialization really need optimize parameter final fully connected layer mean fantastic performance dozen image per class here need optimize  parameters set zero and stay way rest convert shared parameters resulting  actual parameter optimize efficiency matters move  input mnist real world ×× images  inputs dense layer attempting halve input  input would still require  billion parameters comparison entirety   million parameters fixing

article discussed that backpropagation coming way classification node network kernel interesting task learning weight produce feature set local inputs additionally kernel applied across entire image feature kernel learns must general enough come part image kind data eg categorical data app installs would disaster number app installs app type column next mean “local shared features” common app install date time used sure four may underlying higher level feature eg apps people want most found give u reason believe parameter first two exactly parameter latter two four could consistent order still valid pixel however always appear consistent order nearby pixel influence pixel eg nearby pixel red pretty likely pixel also red deviations interesting anomaly could converted feature detected comparing pixel neighbors pixel locality idea really lot earlier computer vision feature extraction method based around instance edge detection one use sobel edge detection filter kernel fixed parameters operating like standard onechannel convolution nonedge containing grid eg background sky pixel value overall output kernel point  grid vertical edge difference pixel left right edge kernel computes difference nonzero activating revealing edges kernel work × grid time detecting anomaly local scale yet applied across entire image enough detect certain feature global scale anywhere image key difference make deep learning ask question useful kernel learnt early layer operating raw pixels could reasonably expect feature detector fairly low level features like edges lines etc entire branch deep learning research focused making neural network model interpretable one powerful tool come feature visualization using  idea core simple optimize image usually initialized random noise activate filter strongly possible make intuitive sense optimized image completely filled edges strong evidence filter looking activated by using this peek learnt filters result stunning one important thing notice convolved image still images output small grid pixel top left image still top left run another convolution layer top another such two left extract deeper features visualize yet however deep feature detector get without change still operating small patch image matter deep detector are cannot detect face × grid idea receptive field come in essential design choice cnn architecture input size grow smaller smaller start end network number channel grow deeper this mentioned earlier often done stride pooling layers locality determines input previous layer output get see receptive field determines area original input entire network output get see idea strided convolution process slide fixed distance apart skip one middle different point view keep output fixed distance apart remove  apply nonlinearity output per usual stack another new convolution layer top thing get interesting even apply kernel size × local area output strided convolution kernel would larger effective receptive field output strided layer still represent image much cropping resizing thing single pixel output “representative” larger area of whose pixel discarded rough location original input next layer’s kernel operates output operating pixel collected larger area note familiar dilated convolutions note dilated convolution method increasing receptive field dilated convolution single layer take place regular convolution following strided convolution nonlinearity inbetween expansion receptive field allows convolution layer combine low level feature lines edges higher level feature curves textures see  layer followed poolingstrided layer network continues create detector even higher level feature parts patterns see  repeated reduction image size across network result in  block convolutions input size × compared input × point single pixel represents grid × pixels huge compared earlier layers activation meant detecting edge here activation tiny × grid one high level feature birds network whole progress small number filter  case googlenet detecting low level features large number  final convolution looking extremely specific high level feature followed final pooling layer collapse × grid single pixel channel feature detector receptive field equivalent entire image compared standard feedforward network would done output really nothing short aweinspiring standard feedforward network would produced abstract feature vectors combination every single pixel image requiring intractable amount data train cnn prior imposed it start learning low level feature detectors across layer receptive field expanded learns combine lowlevel feature progressively higher level features abstract combination every single pixel rather strong visual hierarchy concepts detecting low

mathematical measure tell u much information second sentence compared first scientist struggling questions semantics domain form data added complexity problem then mathematician engineer claude shannon came idea “entropy” changed world forever marked beginning “digital information age” shannon proposed “semantic aspect data irrelevant” nature meaning data matter come information content instead quantified information term probability distribution “uncertainty” shannon also introduced term “bit” humbly credited colleague john tukey revolutionary idea laid foundation information theory

placement people working ai also preparing noticed people using lot resource per experience past months realised one away minimal one role ai going mention end post begin get noticed aka interview provide list company startups apply followed ace interview based whatever experience had add section strive work for conclude minimal resource need preparation note people sitting campus placements two thing would like add firstly going say except last one maybe going relevant placements but second point mentioned before opportunity campus mostly software engineering role intersection ai so post specifically meant people want work solving interesting problem using ai also want add cleared interview guess essence failure — greatest teacher thing mention may useful thing way know might ended making case stronger honest step important one make offcampus placement tough exhausting getting recruiter actually go profile among plethora application get contact inside organisation place referral would make quite easy but general part subdivided three key steps a regulatory preparation well so regulatory preparation mean —a linkedin profile github profile portfolio website wellpolished cv firstly cv really neat concise follow guide udacity cleaning cv — resume revamp everything intend say using reference guide myself cv template inbuilt format overleaf quite nice personally use deedyresume preview seen lot content fit one page however really need that format linked would work directly instead find modified multipage format here next important thing mention github profile lot people underestimate potential this unlike linkedin “who viewed profile” option people go github way validate mentioned cv given lot noise today people associating kind buzzword profile especially data science opensource big role play majority tools implementation various algorithms list learning resources opensourced discus benefit getting involved opensource one start scratch earlier post here bare minimum be • create github account already one• create repository project done• add documentation clear instruction run code• add documentation file mentioning role function meaning parameter proper formatting eg  python along script automate previous step optional moving on third step people lack portfolio website demonstrating experience personal projects making portfolio indicates really serious getting field add lot point authenticity factor also generally space constraint cv tend miss lot details use portfolio really delve deep detail want highly recommended include sort visualisation demonstration projectidea really easy create one lot free platform draganddrop feature making process really painless personally use weebly widely used tool better reference begin with lot awesome one referred deshraj yadav’s personal website begin making mine finally lot recruiter startups nowadays started using linkedin goto platform hiring lot good job get posted there apart recruiters people working influential position quite active well so grab attention good chance getting too apart that maintaining clean profile necessary people connect you important part linkedin search tool show up must relevant keywords interspersed profile took lot iteration reevaluations finally decent one also definitely ask people worked endorse skill add recommendation talking experience working you increase chance actually getting noticed point towards udacity’s guide linkedin github profiles might seem like lot remember need single day even week month process never ends setting everything first would definitely take effort keep updating regularly event around keep happening find quite easy also able talk anywhere anytime without explicitly prepare become aware yourself b stay authentic seen lot people mistake presenting per different job profiles according me always better first decide actually interest you would happy search relevant opportunities way round fact demand ai talent surpasses supply give opportunity spending time regulatory preparation mentioned would give allaround perspective help make decision easier also need prepare answer various kind question get asked interview would come naturally would talking something really care about c networking done a figured b networking actually help get there talk people miss hearing many opportunity might good shot at important keep connecting new people day physically linkedin upon compounding many days large strong network networking messaging people place referral you starting off mistake way often stumbled upon excellent article mark meloon talk importance building real connection people offering help first another important step networking get content out example good something blog share blog facebook linkedin help others help well good enough network visibility increase multifold never know one person network liking commenting posts may help reach much broader audience including people might looking someone expertise presenting list alphabetical order avoid misinterpretation specific preference however place “” one would personally recommend recommendation based either following mission statement people personal interaction scope learning  “” purely based   factors interview begin moment entered room lot thing happen moment time asked introduce — body language fact smiling greeting play big role especially interviewing startup culturefit something extremely care about need understand much interviewer stranger you stranger himher too so probably nervous are important view interview conversation interviewer looking mutual fit — looking awesome place work interviewer looking awesome person like you work with so make sure feeling good take charge making initial moment conversation pleasant them easiest way know make happen smile mostly two type interview — one interviewer come come prepared set question going ask irrespective profile second interview based cv start second one kind interview generally begin “can tell bit yourself” point  thing big — talking gpa college talking project detail ideal statement minute two long give good idea till now restricted academics talk hobby like reading books playing sports meditation etc — basically anything contributes defining you interviewer take something talk cue next question technical part interview begins motive kind interview really check whether whatever written cv true not would lot question could done differently “x” used instead “y” would happened point important know kind tradeoff usually made implementation eg interviewer say using complex model would given better results might say actually le data work would lead overfitting one interviews given casestudy work involved designing algorithm realworld use case noticed given green flag talk project interviewer really like talk following flow problem    previous approach  approach  result  intuition kind interview really test basic knowledge expect question hard would definitely scratch every bit basic having mainly based around linear algebra probability statistics optimisation machine learning andor deep learning resource mentioned minimal resource need preparation section suffice make sure miss one bit among them catch amount time take answer questions since cover basics expect answering almost instantly so preparation accordingly throughout process important confident honest know know question certain idea about say upfront rather making “aah” “um” sounds concept really important struggling answering it interviewer would generally depending initial parts happy give hint guide towards right solution big plus manage pick hint arrive correct solution try get nervous best way avoid by again smiling come conclusion interview interviewer would ask question them really easy think interview done say nothing ask know many people got rejected failing last question mentioned before interviewed also looking mutual fit company itself so quite obvious really want join place must many question regarding work culture kind role seeing in simple curious person interviewing you always something learn everything around make sure leave interviewer impression truly interested part team final question started asking interviewers feedback might want improve on helped tremendously still remember

may say myself – building desti — holistic travel search app ie would search everything — hotel attraction restaurants using postsiri naturallanguageunderstanding tech powerful semantic search capability back end allowed desti reason meaningfully search result make highly informed suggestions desti’s search built premise sound simple actually hard pull off believe people able ask specifically interested get result match sound reasonable right looking beach resort kona coast hawaii pretty obvious want also want kid friendly pet friendly able ask it goal get user inputting relevant specific query people need desti shine — saving time effort delivering exactly want let u assume desti know hotel kona coast actually beach resorts kid friendly pet friendly make expressing query easy intuitive user episode i desti siri’s sister conversational user interfacewhen started naïve this said — first let u put search box there allowing user type say whatever want let u make sure understand this then let u leave box react see provide detail “refine” search something else context eg restaurant near resort — called “pivot” let u run conversation around it kind like siri could natural used sri international’s vpa platform almost literally postsiri naturallanguageinteraction platform conversation context le looked like beta version search box conversational ui launched this monitored use quickly realized early user split two groups discarding  group we busy people learned people know interact naturally computers idea ask expect revert primitive queries problem is goal answer interesting specific queries believe give great answer caters want likelihood buying much higher furthermore absolutely one got conversational aspect — fact continue refining pivoting conversation decided take away focus conversation time being episode  vega slot machine make dead simple realized focus first query give people cue possible came interface contextual spinner turned interaction totally openended query something closer multiplechoice questions essence interchangeable templates could get idea “what search for” well easily input query picked would show textual query search bar hoped people would realize edit add to hoped result — one hand progress saw longer interesting query interaction however talking users realized assuming spinner kind menu system mean a pick menu b pick one thing menu better site search still far cry wanted deliver learned this episode  fill blank — smartly stage clear needed better autosuggest smarter autocomplete similar ui perspective google instant desti semantic search keyword matching cases google autosuggest phrase match typing typed many people desti suggest something semantically match entered make sense given know destination trip desti new million user searching thing you desti reason may ask suggest something someone else asked realized build lot semanticallyreasonable statisticallyrelevant autosuggesting still wanted keep template logic believed help user think looking form query minds came ui blend formfilling natural language entry focused building smart autosuggest autocomplete ui built number rigid field eg location type adapt subject matter so type “hotel” prompted dates free text field allows ask whatever else want iterated lot autocomplete autosuggest features first thing realize different autocomplete user already thought something type in guess is autosuggest really want inspire user adding something useful query mean need relevant whatever know query user far overwhelming user requires knowing lot specific destination what people search hawaii vs new york specific type what relevant hotel vs museums also visual side user putting often quantitative easier “set” “type” — eg date price etc came first crack blending text visual widgets result big improvement quality relevance query previous ui feeling still stiff rigid people asked “type place” — eg museum park hotel — often cannot really answer easier think feature place instead — eg go hiking biking see art eat breakfast linguistic reason easier people say want “romantic hotel” “hotel romantic” ui expressive often felt unnatural limiting furthermore many user ended filling basic field adding depth opentext field despite various visual cues editing query refining pivoting hard time — autosuggest  autocomplete element built stage werealmost enough allow u throw limiting “templates” move one search field — time damn clever one episode  search go natural naked eye look like gone full circle — one text box parsed query shown tags could simpler well exactly still need query meaningful one thing template gave u builtin disambiguation need query least location  type or something derive type without template telling u “hotel” type “restaurant” something want hotel vs maybe opposite system need better understand grammatical structure sentence cue inputting thing right way suggesting autocompleting typing query query understood — add  edit new user interface changing query “refining pivoting” natural — add tags take away tags widget contextually integrated using autosuggest dropdown menu naturally suggested right time eg said looking hotel help choose when many room etc also easy suggest thing search based context instance know kid traveling you would drop “family friendly” could dismiss one click going far natural search look behaves better anything else seen space on focus making guess even smarter statistic reasoning people ask different contexts contextual info driving guesses believe ui vertical search heading consider nice would input “gifts  year old boy ” targetcom’s search bar “romantic restaurant great seafood near time square table  pm tonight” opentable —

speech recognition accurate enough useful outside carefully controlled environments andrew ng long predicted speech recognition go  accurate  accurate become primary way interact computers idea  accuracy gap difference annoyingly unreliable incredibly useful thanks deep learning finally cresting peak let u learn speech recognition deep learning know neural machine translation works might guess could simply feed sound recording neural network train produce text holy grail speech recognition deep learning quite yet at least time wrote — bet couple years big problem speech varies speed one person might say “hello” quickly another person might say “heeeelllllllllllllooooo” slowly producing much longer sound file much data sound file recognized exactly text — “hello” automatically aligning audio file various length fixedlength piece text turn pretty hard work around this use special trick extra precessing addition deep neural network let u see works first step speech recognition obvious — need feed sound wave computer part  learned take image treat array number feed directly neural network image recognition sound transmitted waves turn sound wave numbers let u use sound clip saying “hello” sound wave onedimensional every moment time single value based height wave let u zoom one tiny part sound wave take look turn sound wave numbers record height wave equallyspaced points called sampling taking reading thousand time second recording number representing height sound wave point time basically uncompressed wav audio file is “cd quality” audio sampled   reading per second speech recognition sampling rate   sample per second enough cover frequency range human speech let u sample “hello” sound wave  time per second first  samples might thinking sampling creating rough approximation original sound wave taking occasional readings gap reading must losing data right thanks nyquist theorem know use math perfectly reconstruct original sound wave spacedout sample — long sample least twice fast highest frequency want record mention nearly everyone get wrong assumes using higher sampling rate always lead better audio quality not end rant array number number representing sound wave’s amplitude  second intervals could feed number right neural network trying recognize speech pattern processing sample directly difficult instead make problem easier preprocessing audio data let u start grouping sampled audio  chunks first  millisecond audio ie first  samples plotting number simple line graph give u rough approximation original sound wave  millisecond period time recording  second long even short recording complex mishmash different frequency sound low sounds midrange sounds even highpitched sound sprinkled in taken together different frequency mix together make complex sound human speech make data easier neural network process going break apart complex sound wave component parts break lowpitched parts nextlowestpitchedparts on adding much energy frequency band from low high create fingerprint sort audio snippet imagine recording someone playing c major chord piano sound combination three musical notes— c e g — mixed together one complex sound want break apart complex sound individual note discover c e g exact idea using mathematic operation called fourier transform break apart complex sound wave simple sound wave make up individual sound waves add much energy contained one end result score important frequency range is low pitch ie bass notes high pitch number represents much energy  band  millisecond audio

accurate prediction going forward run entire audio clip neural network one chunk time end mapping audio chunk letter likely spoken chunk mapping look like saying “hello” neural net predicting one likely thing said “hhheelllllooo” also think possible said “hhhuulllllooo” even “aaauulllllooo” step follow clean output first replace repeated character single character remove blanks leaf u three possible transcription — “hello” “hullo” “aullo” say loud sound similar “hello” predicting one character time neural network come soundedout transcriptions example say “he would go” might give one possible transcription “he wud net go” trick combine pronunciationbased prediction likelihood score based large database written text books news articles etc throw transcription seem least likely real keep transcription seems realistic possible transcription “hello” “hullo” “aullo” obviously “hello” appear frequently database text not mention original audiobased training data thus probably correct pick “hello” final transcription instead others done might thinking “but someone say ‘hullo’ valid word maybe ‘hello’ wrong transcription” course possible someone actually said “hullo” instead “hello” speech recognition system like trained american english basically never produce “hullo” transcription unlikely thing user say compared “hello” always think saying “hello” matter much emphasize ‘you’ sound try out phone set american english try get phone’s digital assistant recognize world “hullo” cannot refuses always understand “hello” recognizing “hullo” reasonable behavior sometimes find

representation next character like embeddings talked before operates representation matrix like saw before thing is rnn form internal memory remembers saw previously us memory decide exactly operate next input using memory rnn “remember” inside intended scope get properly nested output text fancy version rnn called long short term memory lstm lstm cleverly designed memory allows lstm see ““ say “oh yeah important remember that” does essentially remembers indication nested scope see corresponding “” decide forget original opening brace thus forget nested scope lstm learn abstract concept stacking top other would make u “deep” again output previous lstm becomes input next lstm one go learn higher abstraction data coming in example and illustrative speculation first layer lstms might learn character separated space “words” next layer might learn word type like static void actionnewfunctionthe next layer might learn concept function argument on hard tell exactly layer doing though karpathy’s blog really nice example visualize exactly that connecting  lstms studious reader notice karpathy used character inputs embeddings technically onehot encoding characters but lars eidnes actually used word embeddings wrote autogenerating clickbait recurrent neural network figure show network used ignore softmax part we get later moment check bottom put sequence word vector bottom one remember “word vector” representation word form bunch numbers like saw beginning post lars input sequence word vector one them going thing one difference instead word vector input “marketvectors” market vector described before recap marketvectors contain summary happening market given point time putting sequence lstms hope capture long term dynamic happening market stacking together layer lstms hope capture higher level abstraction market’s behavior come thus far talked algorithm actually learns anything talked clever transformation data defer conversation paragraph down please keep

word abstract space next step case change abstract representation probability vector list say likely character word respectively likely appear next job softmax function list likelihood select

 million spotify user found fresh new playlist waiting called discover weekly custom mixtape  song never listened probably love pretty much magic huge fan spotify particularly discover weekly why make feel seen know musical taste better person entire life ever has consistently delighted satisfyingly right every week track probably would never found known would like live soundproof rock let introduce virtual best friend turn out alone obsession discover weekly user base go crazy it driven spotify rethink focus invest resource algorithmbased playlists ever since discover weekly debuted  dying know work what more spotify fangirl sometimes like pretend work research products three week mad googling feel like finally gotten glimpse behind curtain spotify amazing job choosing  song person week let u zoom second look music service tackled music recommendations spotify’s better back  songza kicked online music curation scene using manual curation create playlist users meant team “music experts” human curator would put together playlist thought sounded good user would listen playlists later beat music would employ strategy manual curation worked alright based specific curator’s choices therefore could take account listener’s individual music taste like songza pandora also one original player digital music curation employed slightly advanced approach instead manually tagging attribute songs meant group people listened music chose bunch descriptive word track tagged track accordingly then pandora’s code could simply filter certain tag make playlist similarsounding music around time music intelligence agency mit medium lab called echo nest born took radical cuttingedge approach personalized music echo nest used algorithm analyze audio textual content music allowing perform music identification personalized recommendation playlist creation analysis finally taking another approach lastfm still exists today us process called collaborative filtering identify music user might like moment music curation service handled recommendations spotify’s magic engine run seem nail individual users’ taste much accurately services spotify actually use single revolutionary recommendation model instead mix together best strategy used service create uniquely powerful discovery engine create discover weekly three main type recommendation model spotify employs let u dive recommendation model work first background people hear word “collaborative filtering” generally think netflix one first company use method power recommendation model taking users’ starbased movie rating inform understanding movie recommend similar users netflix successful use collaborative filtering spread quickly often starting point anyone trying make recommendation model unlike netflix spotify starbased system user rate music instead spotify’s data implicit feedback — specifically stream count track additional streaming data whether user saved track playlist visited artist’s page listening song collaborative filtering truly work highlevel rundown explained quick conversation going here individual track preferences one left like track p q r s one right like track q r s t collaborative filtering us data say “hmmm like three track — q r — probably similar users therefore likely enjoy track person listened to heard yet” therefore suggests one right check track p — track mentioned “similar” counterpart enjoyed — one left check track t reasoning simple right spotify actually use concept practice calculate million users’ suggested track based million users’ preferences matrix math done python libraries actuality matrix see gigantic row represents one spotify’s  million user — use spotify row matrix — column represents one  million song spotify’s database then python library run long complicated matrix factorization formula finishes end two type vectors represented x y x user vector representing one single user’s taste song vector representing one single song’s profile  million user vector  million song vectors actual content vector bunch number essentially meaningless own hugely useful compared find users’ musical taste similar mine collaborative filtering compare vector users’ vectors ultimately spitting user closest matches go vector songs compare single song’s vector others find song similar one question collaborative filtering pretty good job spotify knew could even better adding another engine enter nlp second type recommendation model spotify employ natural language processing nlp models source

introduced completely new type neural network based socalled capsules addition that team published algorithm called dynamic routing capsules allows train network everyone deep learning community huge news several reasons first all hinton one founder deep learning inventor numerous model algorithm widely used today secondly paper introduce something completely new exciting likely stimulate additional wave research cool applications post explain new architecture important well intuition behind it following post dive technical details however talking capsules need look cnns workhorse today’s deep learning cnns convolutional neural networks awesome one reason deep learning popular today amazing thing people used think computer would capable long long time nonetheless limit fundamental drawbacks let u consider simple nontechnical example imagine face components face oval two eyes nose mouth cnn mere presence object strong indicator consider face image orientational relative spatial relationship component important cnn cnns work main component cnn convolutional layer job detect important feature image pixels layer deeper closer input learn detect simple feature edge color gradients whereas higher layer combine simple feature complex features finally dense layer top network combine high level feature produce classification predictions important thing understand higherlevel feature combine lowerlevel feature weighted sum activation preceding layer multiplied following layer neuron’s weight added passed activation nonlinearity nowhere setup pose translational rotational relationship simpler feature make higher level feature cnn approach solve issue use max pooling successive convolutional layer reduce spacial size data flowing network therefore increase “field view” higher layer’s neurons thus allowing detect higher order feature larger region input image max pooling crutch made convolutional network work surprisingly well achieving superhuman performance many areas fooled performance cnns work better model them max pooling nonetheless losing valuable information hinton stated fact max pooling working well big mistake disaster course away max pooling still get good result traditional cnns still solve key problem example above mere presence  eyes mouth nose picture mean face also need know object oriented relative other computer graphic deal constructing visual image internal hierarchical representation geometric data note structure representation need take account relative position objects internal representation stored computer’s memory array geometrical object matrix represent relative position orientation objects then special software take representation convert image screen called rendering inspired idea hinton argues brains fact opposite rendering call inverse graphics visual information received eyes deconstruct hierarchical representation world around u try match already learned pattern relationship stored brain recognition happens key idea representation object brain depend view angle point question is model hierarchical relationship inside neural network answer come computer graphics  graphics relationship  object represented socalled pose essence translation plus rotation hinton argues order correctly classification object recognition important preserve hierarchical pose relationship object parts key intuition allow understand capsule theory important incorporates relative relationship object represented numerically  pose matrix relationship built internal representation data becomes easy model understand thing see another view something seen before consider image below easily recognize statue liberty even though image show different angles internal representation statue liberty brain depend view angle probably never seen exact picture it still immediately knew was cnn task really hard builtin understanding  space capsnet much easier relationship explicitly modeled paper us approach able cut error rate  compared previous state art huge improvement another benefit capsule approach capable learning achieve stateofthe art performance using fraction data cnn would use hinton mention famous talk wrong cnns sense capsule theory much closer human brain practice order learn tell digit apart human brain need see couple dozen examples hundred most cnns hand need ten thousand example achieve good performance seems like brute force approach clearly inferior brains idea really simple way one come before truth is hinton thinking

challenge let first talk something similar done chess early  ibm came deep blue computer defeated great champion gary kasparov chess he also cool guy make sure read later deep blue play well used brute force method step game took look possible legal move could played went ahead explore every move see would happen would keep exploring move move while forming kind huge decision tree thousand moves would come back along tree observing move seemed likely bring good result but mean “good result” well deep blue many carefully designed chess strategy built expert chess player help make better decision — example decide whether protect king get advantage somewhere else made specific “evaluation algorithm” purpose compare advantageous disadvantageous different board position ibm hardcoded expert chess strategy evaluation function finally chooses carefully calculated move next turn basically go whole thing again see mean deep blue thought million theoretical position playing move impressive term ai software deep blue rather hardware — ibm claimed one powerful computer available market time could look  million board position per second come go believe game much openended tried deep blue strategy go would able play well would many position look step would simply impractical computer go hell example opening move chess  possible moves go first player  possible moves scope choice stay wide throughout game mean “enormous search space” moreover go easy judge advantageous disadvantageous particular board position specific point game — kind play whole game determine winning let u say magically way these deep learning come in research deepmind used neural network task if read yet link again trained “policy neural network” decide sensible move particular board position so like following intuitive strategy pick move position trained “value neural network” estimate advantageous particular board arrangement player or words likely win game position trained neural network first human game example your good old ordinary supervised learning ai able mimic human playing certain degree acted like weak human player train network even further made ai play million time this “reinforcement learning” part this ai got better practice two network alone deepmind’s ai able play well stateoftheart go playing program researcher built before program used already popular preexisting game playing algorithm called “monte carlo tree search” mcts later guess what still talked real deal deepmind’s ai policy value networks use two network replacement monte carlo tree search instead us neural network make mcts algorithm work better got much better reached superhuman levels improved variation mcts “alphago” ai beat lee sedol went ai history one greatest breakthrough ever essentially alphago simply improved implementation ordinary computer science algorithm understand ai current form absolutely nothing scared of wow spent lot time abstract alone alright — understand paper point on first talk gaming strategy called monte carlo tree search algorithm now explain algorithm enough depth make sense essay want learn depth smart people also made excellent video blog post this  short video series  jeff bradberry’s explanation  mcts tutorial fullstack academy following section long easy understand i try best important stay me rest essay go much quicker let u talk first paragraph essay above remember said deep blue making huge tree million board position move step game simulation look compare every possible move said before simple approach straightforward approach — average software engineer design game playing ai strongest computer world would probably design similar solution let u think human play chess let u say particular board position middle game game rules dozen different thing — move pawn here move queen two square three square there on really make list possible move make pieces select one move long list — “intuitively” narrow key move let u say come  sensible moves think make sense wonder happen game chose one  moves might spend – second considering  move future — note  second carefully plan future move “roll out” mental move guided intuition without much careful thought well good player would think farther deeply average player limited time cannot accurately predict opponent step lovely future cooking brain let gut feeling guide you refer part thinking process “rollout” take note itso “rolling out” sensible moves finally say screw play move find best opponent make move might move already well anticipated mean pretty confident need next spend much time rollouts again or could opponent hit pretty cool move expected even careful next movethis game carry on get closer closer finishing point would get easier predict outcome move — rollouts take much time purpose long story describe mcts algorithm superficial level — mimic thinking process building “search tree” move position every time again detail check link mentioned earlier innovation instead going possible move position which deep blue did instead intelligently selects small set sensible move explores instead explore them “rolls out” future move compare based imagined outcomesseriously — think need understand essay — coming back screenshot paper go “perfect information game” please read definition link worry scary theoretically games matter particular position game even played – moves possible correctly guess win lose assuming player play “perfectly” point on idea came theory fundamental assumption research project works means given state game s function vs predict outcome let u say probability winning game   call “optimal value function” board position likely result winning board positions considered “valuable” others let say again value  probability   winning game wait — say girl named foma sitting next play chess keep telling step winning losing “you winning losing nope still losing” think would help much choosing move need make would also quite annoying would instead help drew whole tree possible move make state move would lead — foma would tell entire tree state winning state state losing states choose move keep leading winning states sudden foma partner crime annoying friend here foma behaves optimal value function vs earlier believed possible accurate value function like foma game go game much uncertainty — even wonderful foma wonderland strategy drawing possible position foma evaluate work well real world game like chess go said before try imagine even – move future many possible position enough time check foma foma enough need narrow list move sensible move roll future program that enter lusha lusha skilled chess player enthusiast spent decade watching grand master play chess other look board position look quickly available move make tell likely would chess expert would make move sitting table  possible move point lusha tell probability move would picked expert course sensible move much higher probability pointless move little probability policy function pas given state s give probability possible move expert would make wow — take lusha’s help guide select sensible moves foma tell likelihood winning moves choose move foma lusha approve or want extra careful roll move selected lusha foma evaluate them pick roll future keep letting foma lusha help predict far game’s future — much quicker efficient go move step future mean “reducing search space” use value function foma predict outcomes use policy function lusha give grandmaster probability help narrow move roll out called “monte carlo rollouts” backtrack future present take average value different move rolled out pick suitable action far worked weak amateur level go policy function value function used guide rollouts great phew first line self explanatory mcts start unskilled foma unskilled lusha play better get predicting solid outcome moves “narrowing search beam high probability actions” sophisticated way saying “lusha help narrow move need roll assigning probability expert would play them” prior work used technique achieve strong amateur level ai players even simple or “shallow” call it policy functions yeah convolutional neural network great image processing since neural network take particular input give output essentially function right use neural network become complex function pas image board position let neural network figure going on mean possible create neural network behave like accurate policy value functions rest pretty self explanatory discus foma lusha trained train policy network predicting given position move expert would pick simply use example human game use data good old supervised learning want train another slightly different version policy network use rollouts one smaller faster let u say since lusha experienced take time process position good start narrowingdown process with try make repeat process  still take little much time train faster policy network rollout process i call it lusha’s younger brother jerry know know enough names that trained slow fast policy network enough using human player data try letting lusha play go board days get practice reinforcement learning part — making better version policy network then train foma value prediction determining probability winning let ai practice playing simulated environment observe end result time learn mistake get better better go detail network trained read technical detail later section paper ‘methods’ covered here fact real purpose particular paper show used reinforcement learning neural networks one deepmind’s

essay explaining cool research papers serious would glad work you please leave comment get touch you so first step training policy nn lusha predict move likely played expert nn’s goal allow ai play similar expert human convolutional neural network as mentioned before special kind nn useful image processing take simplified image board arrangement “rectifier nonlinearities” layer added network’s architecture give ability learn complex things ever trained nns before might used “relu” layer are training data form random pair board positions label action chosen human positions regular supervised learning use “stochastic gradient ascent” well algorithm backpropagation here trying maximise reward function reward function probability action predicted human expert want increase probability hey — really need think much this normally train network minimises loss function essentially errordifference predicted outcome actual label called gradient descent actual implementation research paper indeed used regular gradient descent easily find loss function behaves opposite reward function minimising loss maximise reward policy network  layers called “sl policy” network sl  supervised learning data came a say popular website million people play go good sl policy network perform accurate researcher done earlier rest paragraph quite selfexplanatory “rollout policy” remember paragraph ago lusha sl policy network slow cannot integrate well mcts algorithm trained another faster version lusha called jerry younger brother well refers jerry right here see jerry half accurate lusha thousand time faster really help get rolled simulation future faster apply mcts next section have know reinforcement learning already assume whatever say works really want dig detail make sure everything might want read little rl first sl network trained supervised manner using human player move human move data said let practice get better here take sl policy network save file make another copy it use reinforcement learning finetune it here make network play learn outcomes problem training style forever practice one opponent opponent also practicing exclusively much new learning do training practice beat one player is guessed it overfitting technique play well one opponent generalize well opponents fix this well every time finetune neural network becomes slightly different kind player save version neural network list “players” behave slightly differently right great — training neural network randomly make play many different older newer version opponent chosen list version player play slightly differently train player get train even with bingo training thing guiding training process ultimate goal ie winning losing need specially train network thing like capture area board etc give possible legal move choose from say “you win” rl versatile used train policy value network game go here tested accurate rl policy network was without mcts algorithm would remember network directly take board position decide expert would play — use singlehandedly play gameswell result rl finetuned network sl network trained human moves also strong go playing programs must note even training rl policy network sl policy network already better state art — now improved even come part process like value network know baby penguin sneeze louder dog bark actually true thought would like little joke distract scarylooking equation above coming essay again done training lusha here back foma — remember “optimal value function” vs  tell likely win current board position player play perfectly point onso obviously train nn become value function would need perfect player have use strongest player happens rl policy network take current state board state s output probability win game play game get know outcome win loss game state act data sample outcome game act label playing  game  data sample value prediction lol no approach naive cannot use  move game add dataset training data set chosen carefully avoid overfitting move game similar next one move give new position right take state  move add training data label basically lot “kind duplicate” data cause overfitting prevent this choose distinctlooking game states example instead  move game choose  add training set deepmind took  million position  million different games reduce chance duplicate data worked now something conceptual here two way evaluate value board position one option magical optimal value function like one trained above option simply roll future using current policy lusha look final outcome roll out obviously real game would rarely go plans deepmind compared option do also mixture options learn “mixing parameter” little bit later make mental note concept well single neural network trying approximate optimal value function even better thousand mental simulation using rollout policy foma really kicked here replaced fast rollout policy twiceasaccurate but slow rl policy lusha thousand simulation that better foma slightly better slowly foma winner competition proved cannot replaced trained policy value functions combine mcts give birth former world champion destroyer grand masters breakthrough generation weighing two hundred sixty eight pounds one alphaaaaa go section ideally slightly deeper understanding inner working mcts algorithm learned far enough give good feel going here thing note using policy probability value estimations combine roll outs narrow number move want roll step qsa represents value function yousa stored probability position explain remember policy network us supervised learning predict expert moves give likely move rather give probability possible move tell likely expert move probability stored actions call “prior probability” obviously use selecting action explore basically decide whether explore particular move consider two things first playing move likely win yes already “value network” answer first question second question is likely expert would choose move if move super unlikely chosen expert even waste time considering it get policy network let u talk “mixing parameter” see came back it discussed earlier evaluate positions two options one simply use value network using evaluate state along two try quickly play rollout game current strategy assuming player play similarly see win lose saw value function better rollouts general combine both try giving prediction – importance – – on attach  x first attach  second mixing parameter means see hit trial result later paper roll out update search tree whatever information gained simulation next simulation intelligent end simulations pick best move interesting insight here remember rl finetuned policy nn better sl humantrained policy nn put within mcts algorithm alphago using human trained nn proved better choice finetuned nn case value function which would remember us strong player approximate perfect player training foma using rl policy work better training sl policy “doing evaluation take lot computing power really bring big gun able run damn programs” self explanatory “lol program literally blew pant every program came us” go back “mixing parameter” again evaluating positions giving equal importance value function rollouts performed better using one them rest self explanatory reveals interesting insight self explanatory self explanatory read red

imagine faced  chest pick turn different average payout goal maximize total payout receive fixed number turns classic problem called multiarmed bandit start crux problem balance exploration help u learn state good exploitation use know pick best slot machine here utilize value function map action estimated reward called q function first initialize q value equal values then update q value action picking chest based good payout choosing action allows u learn good value function approximate q function using neural network starting shallow one learns probability distribution by using softmax  potential chests value function tell u good estimate action be policy function determines action end taking intuitively might want use policy pick action highest q value performs poorly practice q estimate wrong start gather enough experience trial error need add mechanism policy encourage exploration one way use epsilon greedy consists taking random action probability epsilon start epsilon close  always choosing random actions lower epsilon go along learn chest good eventually learn chest best practice might want take subtle approach either taking action think best random action popular method boltzmann exploration adjust probability based current estimate good chest is adding randomness factor  different state previous example world always state waiting pick  chest front us realword problem consist many different states add environment next now background behind chest alternate  color turn changing average value chests mean need learn q function depends action the chest pick state what color background is version problem called contextual multiarmed bandits surprisingly use approach before thing need add extra dense layer neural network take input vector representing current state world  consequence action another key factor make current problem simpler mosts environments maze depicted above action take impact state world move grid might receive reward might receive nothing next turn different state finally introduce need planning first define q function immediate reward current state plus discounted reward expecting taking future actions solution work q estimate state accurate learn good estimate use method called temporal difference td learning learn good q function idea look limited number step future  example us next  state evaluate reward surprisingly use  look current state estimate reward next turn get great results structure network same need go one forward step receiving error use error back propagate gradients like traditional

advent powerful versatile deep learning framework recent year made possible implement convolution layer deep learning model extremely simple task often achievable single line code however understanding convolutions especially first time often feel bit unnerving term like kernels filters channel stacked onto other yet convolution concept fascinatingly powerful highly extensible post break mechanic convolution operation stepbystep relate standard fully connected network explore build strong visual hierarchy making powerful feature extractor images  convolution fairly simple operation heart start kernel simply small matrix weights kernel “slides”  input data performing elementwise multiplication part input currently on summing result single output pixel kernel repeat process every location slide over converting  matrix feature yet another  matrix features output feature essentially weighted sum with weight value kernel itself input feature located roughly location output pixel input layer whether input feature fall within “roughly location” get determined directly whether area kernel produced output not mean size kernel directly determines many or few input feature get combined production new output feature pretty stark contrast fully connected layer example × input features × output features standard fully connected layer would weight matrix ×   parameters every output feature weighted sum every single input feature convolution allow u transformation  parameters output feature instead “looking at” every input feature getting “look” input feature coming roughly location take note this critical later discussion move on definitely worth looking two technique commonplace convolution layers padding strides padding something pretty clever solve this pad edge extra “fake” pixel usually value  hence oftused term “zero padding” way kernel sliding allow original edge pixel center extending fake pixel beyond edge producing output size input idea stride skip slide location kernel stride  mean pick slide pixel apart basically every single slide acting standard convolution stride  mean picking slide  pixel apart skipping every slide process downsizing roughly factor  stride  mean skipping every  slides downsizing roughly factor  on modern networks resnet architecture entirely forgo pooling layer internal layers favor strided convolution needing reduce output sizes course diagram deal case image single input channel practicality input image  channels number increase deeper go network pretty easy think channels general “view” image whole emphasising aspects deemphasising others key distinction term come handy whereas  channel case term filter kernel interchangeable general case actually pretty different filter actually happens collection kernels one kernel every single input channel layer kernel unique filter convolution layer produce one one output channel like so kernel filter “slides” respective input channels producing processed version each kernel may stronger weight others give emphasis certain input channel others eg filter may red kernel channel stronger weight others hence respond difference red channel feature others perchannel processed version summed together form one channel kernel filter produce one version channel filter whole produce one overall output channel finally bias term way bias term work output filter one bias term bias get added output channel far produce final output channel single filter case down case number filter identical filter process input own different set kernel scalar bias process described above producing single output channel concatenated together produce overall output number output channel number filters nonlinearity usually applied passing input another convolution layer repeat process even mechanic convolution layer down still hard relate back standard feedforward network still explain convolution scale to work much better image data suppose × input want transform × grid using feedforward network would reshape × input vector length  pas densely connected layer  input  outputs one could visualize weight matrix w layer although convolution kernel operation may seem bit strange first still linear transformation equivalent transformation matrix use kernel k size  reshaped × input get × output equivalent transformation matrix would be note matrix equivalent transformation matrix actual operation usually implemented different matrix  convolution then whole still linear transformation time also dramatically different kind transformation matrix  elements  parameter reused several times output node get see select number input the one inside kernel interaction inputs weight set  useful see convolution operation hard prior weight matrix context prior mean predefined network parameters example use pretrained model image classification use pretrained network parameter prior feature extractor final densely connected layer sense direct intuition efficient compared alternatives transfer learning efficient order magnitude compared random initialization really need optimize parameter final fully connected layer mean fantastic performance dozen image per class here need optimize  parameters set zero and stay way rest convert shared parameters resulting  actual parameter optimize efficiency matters move  input mnist real world ×× images  inputs dense layer attempting halve input  input would still require  billion parameters comparison entirety   million parameters fixing parameter  tying parameter increase efficiency unlike transfer learning case know prior good work large general set images know good answer lie feature combination prior lead parameter learn early article discussed that backpropagation coming way classification node network kernel interesting task learning weight produce feature set local inputs additionally kernel applied across entire image feature kernel learns must general enough come part image kind data eg categorical data app installs would disaster number app installs app type column next mean “local shared features” common app install date time used sure four may underlying higher level feature eg apps people want most found give u reason believe parameter first two exactly parameter latter two four could consistent order still valid pixel however always appear consistent order nearby pixel influence pixel eg nearby pixel red pretty likely pixel also red deviations interesting anomaly could converted feature detected comparing pixel neighbors pixel locality idea really lot earlier computer vision feature extraction method based around instance edge detection one use sobel edge detection filter kernel fixed parameters operating like standard onechannel convolution nonedge containing grid eg background sky pixel value overall output kernel point  grid vertical edge difference pixel left right edge kernel computes difference nonzero activating revealing edges kernel work × grid time detecting anomaly local scale yet applied across entire image enough detect certain feature global scale anywhere image key difference make deep learning ask question useful kernel learnt early layer operating raw pixels could reasonably expect feature detector fairly low level features like edges lines etc entire branch deep learning research focused making neural network model interpretable one powerful tool come feature visualization using  idea core simple optimize image usually initialized random noise activate filter strongly possible make intuitive sense optimized image completely filled edges strong evidence filter looking activated by using this peek learnt filters result stunning one important thing notice convolved image still images output small grid pixel top left image still top left run another convolution layer top another such two left extract deeper features visualize yet however deep feature detector get without change still operating small patch image matter deep detector are cannot detect face × grid idea receptive field come in essential design choice cnn architecture input size grow smaller smaller start end network number channel grow deeper this mentioned earlier often done stride pooling layers locality determines input previous layer output get see receptive field determines area original input entire network output get see idea strided convolution process slide fixed distance apart skip one middle different point view keep output fixed distance apart remove  apply nonlinearity output per usual stack another new convolution layer top thing get interesting even apply kernel size × local area output strided convolution kernel would larger effective receptive field output strided layer still represent image much cropping resizing thing single pixel output “representative” larger area of whose pixel discarded rough location original input next layer’s kernel operates output operating pixel collected larger area note familiar dilated convolutions note dilated convolution method increasing receptive field dilated convolution single layer take place regular convolution following strided convolution nonlinearity inbetween expansion receptive field allows convolution layer combine low level feature lines edges higher level feature curves textures see  layer followed poolingstrided layer network continues create detector even higher level feature parts patterns see  repeated reduction image size across network result in  block convolutions input size × compared input × point single pixel represents grid × pixels huge compared earlier layers activation meant detecting edge here activation tiny × grid one high level feature birds network whole progress small number filter  case googlenet detecting low level features large number  final convolution looking extremely specific high level feature followed final pooling layer collapse × grid single pixel channel feature detector receptive field equivalent entire image compared standard feedforward network would done output really nothing short aweinspiring standard feedforward network would produced abstract feature vectors combination every single pixel image requiring intractable amount data train cnn prior imposed it start learning low level feature detectors across layer receptive field expanded learns combine lowlevel feature progressively higher level features abstract combination every single pixel rather strong visual hierarchy concepts detecting low level features using detect higher level feature progress visual hierarchy eventually able detect entire visual concept faces birds trees etc make powerful yet efficient image data visual hierarchy cnns build pretty reasonable assume vision system

stranger you stranger himher too so probably nervous are important view interview conversation interviewer looking mutual fit — looking awesome place work interviewer looking awesome person like you work with so make sure feeling good take charge making initial moment conversation pleasant them easiest way know make happen smile mostly two type interview — one interviewer come come prepared set question going ask irrespective profile second interview based cv start second one kind interview generally begin “can tell bit yourself” point  thing big — talking gpa college talking project detail ideal statement minute two long give good idea till now restricted academics talk hobby like reading books playing sports meditation etc — basically anything contributes defining you interviewer take something talk cue next question technical part interview begins motive kind interview really check whether whatever written cv true not would lot question could done differently “x” used instead “y” would happened point important know kind tradeoff usually made implementation eg interviewer say using complex model would given better results might say actually le data work would lead overfitting one interviews given casestudy work involved designing algorithm realworld use case noticed given green flag talk project interviewer really like talk following flow problem    previous approach  approach  result  intuition kind interview really test basic knowledge expect question hard would definitely scratch every bit basic having mainly based around linear algebra probability statistics optimisation machine learning andor deep learning resource mentioned minimal resource need preparation section suffice make sure miss one bit among them catch amount time take answer questions since cover basics expect answering almost instantly so preparation accordingly throughout process important confident honest know know question certain idea about say upfront rather making “aah” “um” sounds concept really important struggling answering it interviewer would generally depending initial parts happy give hint guide towards right solution big plus manage pick hint arrive correct solution try get nervous best way avoid by again smiling come conclusion interview interviewer would ask question them really easy think interview done say nothing ask know many people got rejected failing last question mentioned before interviewed also looking mutual fit company itself so quite obvious really want join place must many question regarding work culture kind role seeing in simple curious person interviewing you always something learn everything around make sure leave interviewer impression truly interested part team final question started asking interviewers feedback might

additional training help stopped there congrats program recognize bird images trained neural network use it simple script take single image file predicts bird not really see effective network is need test lot images data set created held back  image validation ran  image network predicted correct answer  time seems pretty good right well depends network claim  accurate devil details could mean sort different things example  training image bird  birds program guessed “not bird” every single time would  accurate would also  useless need look closely number overall accuracy judge good classification system really is need look closely failed percentage time failed instead thinking prediction “right” “wrong” let u break four separate category — using validation set  images many time prediction fell category break result like this mistake created equal imagine writing program detect cancer mri image detecting cancer would rather false positive false negatives false negative would worse possible case — program told someone definitely cancer actually did instead looking overall accuracy calculate precision recall metrics precision recall metric give u clearer picture well did

learn build facial recognition system python using openface dlib first step pipeline face detection obviously need locate face photograph try tell apart used camera last  years probably seen face detection action face detection great feature cameras camera automatically pick faces make sure face focus take picture use different purpose — finding area image want pas next step pipeline face detection went mainstream early  paul viola michael jones invented way detect face fast enough run cheap cameras however much reliable solution exist now going use method invented  called histogram oriented gradient — hog short find face image start making image black white need color data find faces look every single pixel image one time every single pixel want look pixel directly surrounding it goal figure dark current pixel compared pixel directly surrounding it want draw arrow showing direction image getting darker repeat process every single pixel image end every pixel replaced arrow arrow called gradient show flow light dark across entire image might seem like random thing do really good reason replacing pixel gradients analyze pixel directly really dark image really light image person totally different pixel values considering direction brightness changes really dark image really bright image end exact representation make problem lot easier solve saving gradient every single pixel give u way much detail end missing forest trees would better could see basic flow lightnessdarkness higher level could see basic pattern image this break image small square  pixel each square count many gradient point major direction how many point up point upright point right etc replace square image arrow direction strongest end result turn original image simple representation capture

code showing generate view hog representation images whew isolated face image deal problem face turned different direction look totally different computer account this try warp picture eye lip always sample place image make lot easier u compare face next steps this going use algorithm called face landmark estimation lot way this going use approach invented  vahid kazemi josephine sullivan basic

even comparing highend multicore cpus given wellknown approach leadership cloud computing sought implement largescale neural network training system leveraged advantage gpus aws cloud wanted use reasonable number machine implement powerful machine learning solution using neural network approach also wanted avoid needing special machine dedicated data center instead leverage full ondemand computing power obtain aws architecting approach leveraging computing power cloud sought strike balance would make fast easy train neural network looking entire training process computing resources capacity use many gpu cores cpu cores aws instances would like use efficiently application this typically need train one multiple model either different datasets configuration eg different international regions configuration need perform hyperparameter tuning combination parameter requires training separate neural network solution take approach using gpubased parallelism training using distributed computation handling hyperparameter tuning different configurations might thinking scenario described people think distributed machine learning traditional sense instance work ng et al cited above distribute learning algorithm different machines approach might make sense cases found always norm especially dataset stored single instance understand why first need explain different level model training process distributed standard scenario particular model multiple instances instance might correspond different partition problem space typical situation different model trained different country region since feature distribution even item space might different one region other represents first initial level decide distribute learning process could have example separate machine train  country netflix operates since region trained entirely independently however explained above training single instance actually implies training testing several models corresponding different combination hyperparameters represents second level process distributed level particularly interesting many parameter optimize good strategy optimize them like bayesian optimization gaussian

proofofconcept work development machine addressing issue scale use cloud second stage started using lenovo  workstation nvidia quadro  gpu gpu  core provides useful baseline experiments especially considering planned using powerful machine gpu aws cloud first attempt train neural network model took  hours ran code train model ’s  instance powerful tesla   cores however training time jumped   hours profiling showed time spent function call nvidia performance primitive library eg   calling npps function repeatedly took  system time  instance lenovo  tried uncover root because worked way around issue reimplementing npps function using customized cuda kernel eg replace  function with replacing npps function way neural network code reduced total training time  instance  hour  minute training  million samples training  million sample took  second gpu time using approach lenovo  total training time also reduced  hour  hours make u believe implementation function suboptimal regardless card specifics implementing “hack” also worked aws team find principled solution would require kernel patch so found performance degradation related nvregcheckpciconfigspace parameter

effect original npps functions decreasing runtime  effect significant even optimized kernel function saving almost  runtime however important note even pci access disabled customized function performed almost  better default ones also point options explored far could useful others first could look optimizing code applying kernel fusion trick combine several computation step one kernel reduce memory access finally could think using theano gpu match compiler python supposed also improve performance cases initial work done using   instances interested moving new  gpu  instance type grid  gpu  chip  cores currently application also bounded gpu memory bandwidth grid ‘s memory bandwidth  gbsec improvement tesla ’s  gbsec course using gpu faster memory would also help eg titan’s memory bandwidth  gbsec repeated comparison default npps function customized one with without pci space access  instances one initial surprise measured worse performance npps  instance  pci space access enabled however disabling improved performance   compared  instances again kernelmulc customized function  better benchmark time second thus switching  right configuration allowed u run experiment faster alternatively larger experiment amount time optimized singlenode training testing operations ready tackle issue hyperparameter optimization familiar concept simple explanation machine learning algorithm parameter tune called often called hyperparameters distinguish model parameter produced result learning algorithm example case neural network think optimizing number hidden units learning rate regularization weight order tune these need train test several different combination hyperparameters pick best one final model naive approach simply perform exhaustive grid search different possible combination reasonable hyperparameters however faced complex model training one time consuming many hyperparameters tune prohibitively costly perform exhaustive grid searches luckily better thinking parameter tuning optimization problem itself one way use bayesian optimization approach algorithm’s performance respect set hyperparameters modeled sample gaussian process

next step case change abstract representation probability vector list say likely character word respectively likely appear next job softmax function list likelihood select character word likely appear next case “predicting market” need ask exactly want market predict option thought were   regression problems predict actual number instead likelihood specific event like letter n appearing market

would keep exploring move move while forming kind huge decision tree thousand moves would come back along tree observing move seemed likely bring good result but mean “good result” well deep blue many carefully designed chess strategy built expert chess player help make better decision — example decide whether protect king get advantage somewhere else made specific “evaluation algorithm” purpose compare advantageous disadvantageous different board position ibm hardcoded expert chess strategy evaluation function finally chooses carefully calculated move next turn basically go whole thing again see mean deep blue thought million theoretical position playing move impressive term ai software deep blue rather hardware — ibm claimed one powerful computer available market time could look  million board position per second come go believe game much openended tried deep blue strategy go would able play well would many position look step would simply impractical computer go hell example opening move chess  possible moves go first player  possible moves scope choice stay wide throughout game mean “enormous search space” moreover go easy judge advantageous disadvantageous particular board

compare every possible move said before simple approach straightforward approach — average software engineer design game playing ai strongest computer world would probably design similar solution let u think human play chess let u say particular board position middle game game rules dozen different thing — move pawn here move queen two square three square there on really make list possible move make pieces select one move long list — “intuitively” narrow key move let u say come  sensible moves think make sense wonder happen game chose one  moves might spend – second considering  move future — note  second carefully plan future move “roll out” mental move guided intuition without much careful thought well good player would think farther deeply average player limited time cannot accurately predict opponent step lovely future cooking brain let gut feeling guide you refer part thinking process “rollout” take note itso “rolling out” sensible moves finally say screw play move find best opponent make move might move already well anticipated mean pretty confident need next spend much time rollouts again or could opponent hit pretty cool move expected even careful next movethis game carry on get closer closer finishing point would get easier predict outcome move — rollouts take much time purpose long story describe mcts algorithm superficial level — mimic thinking process building “search tree” move position every time again detail check link mentioned earlier innovation instead going possible move position which deep blue did instead intelligently selects small set sensible move explores instead explore them “rolls out” future move compare based imagined outcomesseriously — think need understand essay — coming back screenshot paper go “perfect information game” please read definition link worry scary theoretically games matter particular position game even played – moves possible correctly guess win lose assuming player play “perfectly” point on idea came theory fundamental assumption research project works means given state game s function vs predict outcome let u say probability winning game   call “optimal value function” board position likely result winning board positions considered “valuable” others let say again value  probability   winning game wait — say girl named foma sitting next play chess keep telling step winning losing “you winning losing nope still losing” think would help much choosing move need make would also quite annoying would instead help drew whole tree possible move make state move would lead — foma would tell entire tree state winning state state losing states choose move keep leading winning states sudden foma partner crime annoying friend here foma behaves optimal value function vs earlier believed possible accurate value function like foma game go game much uncertainty — even wonderful foma wonderland strategy drawing possible position foma evaluate work well real world game like chess go said before try imagine even – move future many possible position enough time check foma foma enough need narrow list move sensible move roll future program that enter lusha lusha skilled chess player enthusiast spent decade watching grand master play chess other look board position look quickly available move make tell likely would chess expert would make move sitting table  possible move point lusha tell probability move would picked expert course sensible move much higher probability pointless move little probability policy function pas given state s give probability possible move expert would make wow — take lusha’s help guide select sensible moves foma tell likelihood winning moves choose move foma lusha approve or want extra careful roll move selected lusha foma evaluate them pick roll future keep letting foma lusha help predict far game’s future — much quicker efficient go move step future mean “reducing search space” use value function foma predict outcomes use policy function lusha give grandmaster probability help narrow move roll out called “monte carlo rollouts” backtrack future present take average value different move rolled out pick suitable action far worked weak amateur level go policy function value function used guide rollouts great phew first line self explanatory mcts start unskilled foma unskilled lusha play better get predicting solid outcome moves “narrowing search beam high probability actions” sophisticated way saying “lusha help narrow move need roll assigning probability expert would play them” prior work used technique achieve strong amateur level ai players even simple or “shallow” call it policy functions yeah convolutional neural network great image processing since neural network take particular input give output essentially function right use neural network become complex function pas image board position let neural network figure going on mean possible create neural network behave like accurate policy value functions rest pretty self explanatory discus foma lusha trained train policy network predicting given position move expert would pick simply use example human game use data good old supervised learning want train another slightly different version policy network use rollouts one smaller faster let u say since lusha experienced take time process position good start narrowingdown process with try make repeat process  still take little much time train faster policy network rollout process i call it lusha’s younger brother jerry know know enough names that trained slow fast policy network

image processing take simplified image board arrangement “rectifier nonlinearities” layer added network’s architecture give ability learn complex things ever trained nns before might used “relu” layer are training data form random pair board positions label action chosen human positions regular supervised learning use “stochastic gradient ascent” well algorithm backpropagation here trying maximise

errordifference predicted outcome actual label called gradient descent actual implementation research paper indeed used regular gradient descent easily find loss function behaves opposite reward function minimising loss maximise reward policy network  layers called “sl policy” network sl  supervised learning data came a say popular website million people play go good sl policy network perform accurate researcher done earlier rest paragraph quite selfexplanatory “rollout policy” remember paragraph ago lusha sl policy network slow cannot integrate well mcts algorithm trained another faster version lusha called jerry younger brother well refers jerry right here see jerry half accurate lusha thousand time faster really help get rolled simulation future faster apply mcts next section have know reinforcement learning already assume whatever say works really want dig detail make sure everything might want read little rl first sl network trained supervised manner using human player move human move data said let practice get better here take sl policy network save file make another copy it use reinforcement learning finetune it here make network play learn outcomes problem training style forever practice one opponent opponent also practicing exclusively much new learning do training practice beat one player is guessed it overfitting technique play well one opponent generalize well opponents fix this well every time finetune neural network becomes slightly different kind player save version neural network list “players” behave slightly differently right great — training neural network randomly make play many different older newer version opponent chosen list version player play slightly differently train player get train even with bingo training thing guiding training process ultimate goal ie winning losing need specially train network thing like capture area board etc give possible legal move choose from say “you win” rl versatile used train policy value network game go here tested accurate rl policy network was without mcts algorithm would remember network directly take board position decide expert would play — use singlehandedly play gameswell result rl finetuned network sl network trained human moves also strong go playing programs must note even training rl policy network sl policy network already better state art — now improved even come part process like value network know baby penguin sneeze louder dog bark actually true thought would like little joke distract scarylooking equation above coming essay again done training lusha here back foma — remember “optimal value function” vs  tell likely win current board position player play perfectly point onso obviously train nn become value function would need perfect player have use strongest player happens rl policy network take current state board state s output probability win game play game get know outcome win loss game state act data sample outcome game act label playing  game  data sample value prediction lol no approach naive cannot use  move game add dataset training data set chosen carefully avoid overfitting move game similar next one move give new position right take state  move add training data label basically lot “kind duplicate” data cause overfitting prevent this choose distinctlooking game states example instead  move game choose  add training set deepmind took  million position  million different games reduce chance duplicate data worked now something conceptual here two way evaluate value board position one option magical optimal value function like one trained above option simply roll future using current policy lusha look final outcome roll out obviously real game would rarely go plans deepmind compared option do also mixture options learn “mixing parameter” little bit later make mental note concept well single neural network trying approximate optimal value function even better thousand mental simulation using rollout

replaced trained policy value functions combine mcts give birth former world champion destroyer grand masters breakthrough generation weighing two hundred sixty eight pounds one alphaaaaa go section ideally slightly deeper understanding inner working mcts algorithm learned far enough give good feel going here thing note using policy probability value estimations combine roll outs narrow number move want roll step qsa represents value function yousa stored probability position explain remember policy network us supervised learning predict expert moves give likely move rather give probability possible move tell likely expert move probability stored actions call “prior probability” obviously use selecting action explore basically decide whether explore particular move consider two things first playing move likely win yes already “value network” answer first question second question is likely expert would choose move if move super unlikely chosen expert even waste time considering it get policy network let u talk “mixing parameter” see came back it discussed earlier evaluate positions two options one simply use value network using evaluate state along two try quickly play rollout game current strategy assuming player play similarly see win lose saw value function better rollouts general combine both try giving prediction – importance – – on attach  x first attach  second mixing parameter means see hit trial result later paper roll out update search tree whatever information gained simulation next simulation intelligent end simulations pick best move interesting insight here remember rl finetuned policy nn better sl humantrained policy nn put within mcts algorithm alphago using human trained nn proved better choice finetuned nn case value function which would remember us strong player approximate perfect player training foma using rl policy work better training sl policy “doing evaluation take lot computing power really bring big gun able run damn programs” self explanatory “lol program literally blew pant every program came us” go back “mixing parameter” again evaluating positions giving equal importance value function rollouts performed

implication future ai research are let u start general approach alphago alphago zero took playing go alphago alphago zero evaluated go board chose move using combination two methods alphago alphago zero worked cleverly combining two methods let u look one turn go sufficiently complex game computer cannot simply search possible move using brute force approach find best one indeed cannot even come close best go program prior alphago overcame using “monte carlo tree search” mcts high level method involves initially exploring many possible move board focusing exploration time certain move found likely lead win others alphago alphago zero use relatively straightforward version mcts “lookahead” simply using many best practice listed monte carlo tree search wikipedia page properly manage tradeoff exploring new sequence move deeply explore alreadyexplored sequence for more see detail “search” section “methods” original alphago paper published nature though mcts core successful go program prior alphago deepmind’s clever combination technique neural networkbased “intuition” allowed surpass human performance deepmind’s major innovation alphago use deep neural network understand state game use understanding intelligently guide search mcts specifically trained network could look given information neural network could recommend deepmind train neural network this here alphago alphago zero used different approaches start first alphago’s alphago two separately trained neural networks deepmind combined two neural network mcts — is program’s “intuition” brute force “lookahead” search— clever way used network trained predict move guide branch game tree search used network trained predict whether position “winning” evaluate position encountered search allowed alphago intelligently search upcoming move ultimately allowed beat lee sedol alphago zero however took whole new level high level alphago zero work way alphago specifically play go using mctsbased lookahead search intelligently guided neural network however alphago zero’s neural network — “intuition” — trained completely differently alphago let u say neural network attempting “understand” game go is every board position using deep neural network generate evaluation best move are deepmind realized matter intelligent neural network — whether completely clueless go master — evaluation always made better mcts fundamentally mcts performs kind lookahead search would imagine human master would perform given enough time intelligently guess variations— sequence future move — promising simulates variations evaluates good actually are update assessment current best move accordingly illustration below suppose neural network reading board determining given move result game even evaluation  then network intelligently look ahead move find sequence move forced current position end resulting evaluation  update evaluation current board position reflect lead favorable position road lookahead search therefore always give u improved data good various move current position neural network evaluating are true whether neural network playing amateur level expert level always generate improve evaluation looking ahead seeing current option actually lead better positions addition alphago would also want neural network learn move likely lead wins so also before agent—using mctsimproved evaluation current state neural network — could play game itself winning losing others data generated purely via lookahead selfplay deepmind used train alphago zero specifically much made fact game human used train alphago zero first “trick” reason why given state go agent always made smarter performing mctsbased lookahead using result lookahead improve agent alphago zero able continuously improve amateur way better best human players second trick novel neural network structure call “two headed monster” alphago zero’s neural network architecture “twoheaded” architecture first  layer layer “blocks” type often seen modern neural net architecures layer followed two “heads” one head took output first  layer produced probability go agent making certain moves another took output first  layer outputted probability current player winning quite unusual almost applications neural network output single fixed output — probability image containing dog vector containing probability image containing one  type objects net learn receiving two set signals one good evaluation board are another good specific move selecting are answer simple remember neural network fundamentally mathematical function bunch parameter determine prediction make “teach” repeatedly showing “correct answers” update parameter answer produce closely match correct answers so use two headed neural net make prediction using head  simply update parameter led making prediction namely parameter “body” “head ” similarly make prediction using head  update parameter “body” “head ” deepmind trained single “twoheaded” neural network used guide mcts search alphago two separate neural networks trick accounted half alphago zero’s increase playing strength alphago this trick known technically multitask learning hard parameter sharing sebastian ruder great overview here half increase playing strength simply came bringing neural network architecture uptodate latest advance field alphago zero used “cutting edge” neural network architecture alphago specifically used “residual” neural network architecture instead purely “convolutional” architecture residual net pioneered microsoft research late  right around time work first version alphago would wrapped up understandable deepmind use original alphago program interestingly chart shows two neural networkrelated trick — switching convolutional residual architecture using “two headed monster” neural network architecture instead separate neural network — would resulted half increase playing strength achieved combined three trick enabled alphago zero achieve incredible performance blew away even alpha go worth noting alphago use classical even “cutting edge” reinforcement learning concept — deep q learning asynchronous actorcritic agents anything else typically associate reinforcement learning simply used simulation generate training data neural net learn supervised fashion denny britz sum idea well tweet alphago zero paper released “stepbystep” timeline alphago zero trained  selfplay game happening sample  position recent  games along whether game lost move record a result mcts evaluation position — “good” various move position based lookahead — b whether current player lost game  train neural network using a move evaluation produced mcts lookahead search b whether current player lost  finally every  iteration step – evaluate current neural network previous best version win least  games begin using generate selfplay game instead prior version repeat step –  times selfplay game continuously played — three days alphago zero many implication deepmind’s incredible achievement future ai research couple key ones first fact selfplay data generated simulation “good enough” able train network suggests simulated selfplay data train agent surpass human performance extremely complex tasks even starting completely scratch — data generated human expert may needed second “two headed monster” trick seems significantly help agent learn perform several related task many domains since seems prevent agent overfitting behavior individual task deepmind seems really like trick used advanced version build agent learn multiple task several different domains many project robotics especially burgeoning field using simulation teach robotic agent use limb accomplish tasks using two trick great effect pieter abbeel’s recent nip keynote highlight many impressive new result use trick along many bleeding edge reinforcement learning techniques indeed locomotion seems like perfect use case “two headed monster”

bandwidth use probably something lifi future could router lightbulb house simply previous history running honest node system used pas “resource test phase” resources pow pos pobandwidth pohonesty measured quantified resource essentially set equivalent resource pool ie pool people similar resource power earn iota’s people using oracle system smart contract simply want computational power which absolutely needed able outsource iot industry sure future mean remember questions iota work people run nodes get incentive like traditional blockchains well can that “q” take every aspect crypto combine one pos pow pobandwidth pohonesty so asic’s asic’s pool gpu’s gpu pool old crappy computer you old crappy computer pool stake lot iota highstake iota pool etc process “proving” resource network people purchase “resources” using qubic protocol want quality fast extreme computational power pay remember user set want receive iota resource economic principles spend  month electricity equipment charge  month resources one would charge less so pool everyone eventually come quorum charging set amount thus economy the users pay it so essence better pool reward get based economic principal society just like blockchain fully understand exact quantitative measure equates reward such hash power blockchain though seems prove resource machine performs calculation bought qubic network however coffee pot jinni chip ternary hardware ternary programming abra sell resource making coffee ie proving resource completing computation buyers speculative abra ternary language able interface binary lower energy consumption significant amount combining abra ternary chip jinn energy efficiency even more one major bottle neck challenge prevents advancement technology amount battery storage within machines cannot redesign battery store power least redesign energy consumption within machine devices also autonomous car offer pow also stake iota’s using wallet bandwidth working

tangle importantly take coo coordinator offline note may use case multiple coo’s coordinators private coo’s whole arena simply state read someone writing example went right head point is q needed remove coo so everyone says “why dev’s focus working removing coo “wen remove coo” see working it” qubic network support network incentive people host node earn iota also one us qubic network work right so making “corporate partners” united nation ngo affiliates partnership banks needed support qubic network building block dev’s vision  need tangle zero fee transaction send meta data  need iota a transfer mean metadata form payment buy sell resource ie pow pos pobandwidth pohonesty  need qubic network creates oracles allows quorum based computation power oracles  need oracle oracles power

d’examen d’arcueil mille têtes sont laborieusement penchées sur de bureau en bois abîmés par le stylos qui grattent sur de mince feuilles de papier le voies ferrées bordent l’enclave le train font trembler le bâtiment en rythme le têtes se relèvent un instant distraites puis s’en retournent se concentrer sur l’écriture studieuse et pressée de la copie le surveillants passent dans le rangs impassibles guettent toute tête qui tourne toute main qui se dérobe dans la poche d’un jean seuls le bruits de papier froissé sont perceptibles et lorsqu’ils s’estompent un silence de mort règne sur la salle mille élèves sont isolés pour répondre en six heures à une question difficile toute interaction avec leurs pair leur est interdite il ne peuvent consulter leurs note si un oubli inattendu vient perturber le fil de leur pensée le devoir produits par le élèves tomberont dans l’oubli stockées dans un hangar dédié qui accueille de papiers d’examen depuis maintes générations quelques années plus tard j’anime un atelier qui s’étend sur toute la journée dans une grande salle blanche avec une vingtaine d’ordinateurs autour de moi de groupes d’élèves discutent rient et oscillent entre une feuille de dessin et l’écran d’ordinateur certains s’isolent pour coder d’autres sont penchés sur une imprimante  qui produit un design open source qu’ils viennent de télécharger le élèves consultent leurs professeurs demandent conseil aux expert présents dans la salle et partagent leur avancement avec le autres certains abandonnent momentanément leur propre groupe pour aider leurs amis dans un groupe concurrent l’atelier consiste à remixer de œuvres artistiques tombées dans le domaine public ou en open source aucune évaluation n’est prévue le réactions de personnes présentes est la seule mesure de la qualité de leur production je pense en le regardant qu’ils ont une chance infinie de pouvoir librement puiser dans tous le puits de connaissance existants  leur intelligence celle de pair et accompagnateurs la quasitotalité de production de l’humanité et surtout le savoir global présent à portée de main la clôture de l’atelier leurs œuvres nous paraissent surprenantes originales et leur qualité dépasse toutes attentes doutes sur la capacité de élèves à défricher de la matière brute et en extraire une forme structurée en une aprèsmidi étaient vains il nous font désormais sourire j’observe la magie de la création collective tous le jours au sein de ouishare projet collectif œuvrant pour le développement de l’économie collaborative le projet rassemble de personnes venue de tous le coin du monde et j’ai beaucoup de chance de m’investir chaque jour pour chacun de projets que nous conduisons pour chaque décision que nous prenons et à chacun de désaccords qui surgit nous faisons l’expérience d’une coopération intelligente au sein de ce laboratoire d’idées et de pratiques nous avon la volonté de soutenir le projets collaboratifs qui surgissent dans le cuisines le espaces de coworking lors de rencontres aussi nous appliquonsnous à apprendre au sein de notre communauté comment peut créer ensemble mieux que ne le ferait chacun de nous seul c’est l’alchimie de l’intelligence collective ensemble en coopérant crée et pense mieux que seul reclus dans le monastère qu’est notre cerveau nous avon désormais un accès immédiat à la grande somme du savoir existant mais c’est avec le autres aujourd’hui et demain que nous créons bien nous somme reliés à une infinité d’individus organisations machines la coopération de l’ensemble de ce entités quelle que soit leur nature quelle que soit la nature de leur intelligence est ce qui définit à mon sen l’intelligence collective le enjeux de l’évolution de notre penserensemble et déciderensemble dans le monde de demain sont critiques aussi nous avon de nouveaux compagnons qui nous assistent sans cesse — le machines le programmes le robot — et qui modifient façons d’agir et de penser autant que nous le façonnons ce bouleversements de notre existence et de mode d’organisation connaissent aujourd’hui une accélération telle que le questionnement sur le processus et le effets de ce interaction acquiert une consistance inédite nous ne pouvons plus ignorer que nous humains ne serons plus jamais seuls dans ce contexte critique comment définir l’intelligence collective et intégrer le machine dans la production de connaissances à venir  interaction nous conduirontelles à nous améliorer en tant qu’individus et espèce ou scellerontelles une nouvelle ère de guerre numérique  si nous voulons utiliser en toute conscience notre capacité à coopérer pour rendre le monde meilleur quels modèles économiques sociaux éthiques et technologiques devon nous bâtir  le telos de l’intelligence collective s’inscrit dans le concept de noosphère forgé par vladimir vernadsky et longuement analysé par teilhard de chardin comprise comme l’ensemble de la pensée humaine la noosphère correspond à deux phénomènes en interaction réciproque d’une part la complexification de sociétés humaines du point de vue culturel social économique et démographique tend vers la constitution d’une sphère de la connaissance toujours plus étoffée d’autre part cette sphère née de la multiplication de interaction toujours plus nombreuses entraîne une structuration progressive de la pensée globale et la prise de conscience par l’humanité d’ellemême l’idée d’une marche vers une sorte de cerveau humain qui nous transcende aussi ancienne  prend une consistante particulière à l’heure où  de la planète est connectée à la toile l’intelligence collective peut alors être comprise comme le processus de création de savoir éclairé par la conscience d’une noosphère la noosphère soustend la possibilité d’une production collective de savoir mais elle ne répond pa aux question qui se posent si l’on examine le processus de cocréation l’approche pratique de l’intelligence collective permet quant à elle d’explorer le condition de possibilité de l’exercice collectif de l’intelligence d’individus entités ou machines cet effet je tourne vers le travaux du centre de recherche sur l’intelligence collective du  le recherches et analysis conduites par ce centre sont uniques en leur genre en combinant le science mathématiques physiques biologiques sociales économiques et une approche résolument prospective le travaux du centre ont pour ambition de répondre à la question suivante  comment le individus et le machine peuvent se connecter afin que collectivement il soient en mesure d’agir avec plus d’intelligence que ne l’ont jamais pu tout individu groupe ou machine pris séparément  l’ampleur de la tâche ne fait pa peur à thomas malone fondateur et président du centre selon lui l’enjeu de la recherche est critique car selon lui “le futur de notre espèce pourrait reposer sur notre capacité à faire usage de notre intelligence collective de telle manière que le choix qui sont faits soient non seulement intelligents mais aussi sage » la portée pratique de l’intelligence collective commence à se dessiner  d’une part il s’agit de trouver une configuration telle que la cocréation aboutisse à de choix ordonnés efficients utiles et qui répondent à une certaine éthique d’autre part estil raisonnable de supposer qu’une configuration favorable à la cocréation intelligente entre individus puisse également intégrer le machine  comme le rappelle justement thomas malone le décisions collective peuvent parfaitement être rationnelles et bê  la notion d’intelligence doit par conséquent être élargie pour intégrer de facteurs autres que la seule rationalité thomas malone la définit ainsi  “pour être intelligent le comportement collectif du groupe doit déployer de caractéristiques telles que la perception la capacité d’apprentissage le jugement et l’aptitude à résoudre de problèmes” en d’autres termes le aptitude d’un groupe et celles de individus doivent fonctionner comme de vas communicant  dans une configuration propice à la coproduction le groupe se dote ainsi d’une série de comportements qui sont normalement associés au seul individu le centre de recherche du mit ensuite cherché à déterminer le facteurs qui sont corrélés à une production collective plus intelligente il s’est avéré que l’intelligence moyenne de chaque individu n’en fait pa partie en revanche deux facteurs ressortent significativement  le degré d’empathie de membres du groupe et l’égale distribution de la parole au sein du groupe empathie distribution et égalité ce facteurs laissent à penser que l’intelligence collective s’accommode mal de mode d’organisation hiérarchiques cloisonnées et centralisées l’intelligence collective prospère à l’inverse dans de organisation structurées en réseau distribuées décentralisées centrées sur la perception et l’écoute davantage que sur de règles rigides il n’est pa étonnant que le réseaux contributifs tels que wikipedia prospèrent  il présentent exactement le caractéristiques qui stimulent l’intelligence collective  il faut à mon sen un ingrédient supplémentaire pour que la multiplicité de individus composant le réseau ne fasse par le lit de passagers clandestins rappelons à ce titre que seulement  de lecteurs de wikipedia sont contributeurs actifs l’anonymat de la contribution est pour quelque chose  la valeur produite par chacun n’est ni mesurée ni reconnue l’inverse au sein de  réseau ouvert où un ensemble d’individus et d’organisations produisent de solution hardware de façon contributive la valeur ajoutée de chaque contributeur est régulièrement mesurée par le autres contributeurs et connue par le réseau ainsi l’évaluation et la reconnaissance par le pair de la valeur de la contribution de chacun sont tout aussi importantes que l’évaluation de la valeur globale du réseau comme l’écrit pierre lévy  « le fondement et la fin de l’intelligence collective consiste en la reconnaissance mutuelle et l’enrichissement de individus plutôt que le culture d’une communauté fétichisée et hypostasiée » un réseau intelligent apporte autant au monde qu’à contributeurs  le party pour le tout le tout pour le parties véritable lieu d’apprentissage le réseau favorise la circulation libre de connaissances et la confrontation de jugements dans le respect de la contribution de chacun contrairement aux mode d’organisation où le collectif écrase l’individu un réseau intelligent est à la fois prolongement et ferment de l’intelligence de chacun l’intention de collaborer et la conscience de la valeur ainsi créée sont indispensables pour que l’intelligence collective puisse s’exercer empathie perception jugement conscience intentionnalité  ne sontce pa de attributs proprement humains  comment intégrer le machine dans un réseau intelligent alors qu’elles en sont priori dépourvues  pourtant lorsque j’évoquais plus haut la mise en réseau d’entités et d’individus afin de déterminer une organisation optimale pour la production collective de valeur je n’excluais pa le machines ce dernières sont aujourd’hui largement acceptées comme prolongement de moyens humains et l’idée de l’avènement prochain de la singularité trouve un nombre croissant d’ aujourd’hui la complexité et l’intelligence de programme informatiques sont telles que nous somme arrivés à un point de non retour qui selon kevin  advient lorsque « la technologie nous altère autant que nous altérons la technologie » mon sens la conception de machine comme assistant parfaitement dominé par l’homme est tout aussi contestable que la foi en la supériorité de l’intelligence de machine sur la nôtre d’une part le programme informatiques sont dotés de capacités de calcul et d’analyse de données qui dépassent manifestement le capacités de l’intelligence humaine d’autre part le robot conçus aujourd’hui sont non seulement capables de se dupliquer mais également d’apprendre et d’é le recherches conduites par l’institut public de recherche en science du numériques portent sur le développement le développement cognitif est stimulé par la curiosité la perception et le représentations rapportées à l’échelle de l’évolution humaine ce avancées ont été d’une rapidité inouïe si le rythme de avancées de ce dernières années persiste dans le années avenir il n’est pa fantaisiste d’imaginer que le robot de demain puissent comprendre le émotions et le reproduire autogénérer de programme sur la base de information interne et externes afin de manifester de façon autonome de pensées de émotions de actions cette autonomie si elle lieu confère à la machine de attributs qui ont jusqu’ici été le propre de l’humain  la conscience la perception la production autonome objectivement nous n’avons pa aujourd’hui suffisamment de données scientifiques pour affirmer que l’autonomie de la technologie est totalement exclue il est donc plus prudent de supposer qu’elle est possible quel qu’en soit l’horizon temporel inversement l’évolution de technique laisse entrevoir un futur où l’homme non content d’améliorer le programme informatiques serait doté de moyens technologiques qui rendent plausibles une intervention sur luimême une amélioration physique et pourquoi pas comportementale morale cette vision prend rapidement le couleurs d’un scénario de sciencefiction où le machines dotées d’autonomie et de conscience finissent par se soulever contre le joug humain pour nous dominer ou simplement pour réclamer le mêmes droits que notre espèce la dialectique du maître et de l’esclave n’est jamais loin  nous ne pouvons nous empêcher de transposer le schémas historiques au monde à venir derrière cette pensée par analogie se cache une peur viscérale d’être dépossédé de moyens de contrôle puisque le machine que nous concevons seraient infiniment plus rapides et efficaces que nous l’angoisse de bouleversements éthiques à venir se pare souvent de habit du principe de précaution  puisque nous ne somme pa absolument certains que la technologie ne présentera aucun danger pour l’humanité ralentissons et encore mieux sonnons le glas de  peuton pour autant postuler que le progrès technologique est absolument autonome par rapport à toute question éthique et que par conséquent la prise en compte de conséquences de l’humanisation de machine et de l’irruption du mécanique dans le vivant n’a aucune place dans le laboratoire du chercheur  je ne le crois pas car le technology que nous produisons ne sont pa de artefacts et ne peut faire abstraction de répercussions qu’elles auront sur le monde à venir face à ce deux partispris — antitechnologique et aéthique — l’hypothèse de la coopération entre l’intelligence humaine et l’intelligence mécanique est au stade de connaissances raisonnable et souhaitable fautil encore reconnaître que le machine peuvent déployer une intelligence qui n’est pa seulement calculatoire et qui si elle serum différente ne serum pa forcément inférieure à la nôtre que ce mouvement provoque de bouleversements que l’espèce humaine n’a jamais connus cela semble peu sujet au doute toutefois ralentir la science parce que nous peinons à prendre conscience de l’accélération de l’avancée technologique est une impasse au contraire c’est à nous d’imaginer et de mettre en pratique le mode de coopération qui fertilisent la production commune de savoir de connaissance et surtout de conscience nous en somme à un moment historique où l’humain et le technologique ne sont plus deux sphères capables d’évoluer sans s’altérer l’une l’autre la technologie est autant notre prolongement que nous somme le sien car le futur de notre espèce est désormais dépendant tant de l’écologie que de la technologie je conclurai en disant que le nouvelles organisation distribuées favorisent tant la cocréation entre le hommes qu’entre le hommes et le machines la diversité de entités composant le réseau combiné à la reconnaissance de la contribution de chacun à sa juste valeur et selon moyens constitue un

start  view work setting brainjs extremely easy spend much time detail going expect input data formatted go first let u start looking setup example included documentation which slightly modified here illustrates pretty well first all example actually working ai it look given color tell whether black text white text would legible it hopefully illustrates easy brainjs use instantiate it train it run it it mean inlined training data would  line code pretty cool let u talk training data minute two important thing note example overall input  output  format training data first data need length see line  above r b value get passed whereas two input pas r g b value also even though example show input objects worth mentioning could also use arrays mention largely passing array varying length project second valid rgb values every one would come black actually use it input value   order brainjs work them so example color processed probably fed function divide  — max value rgb order make work thing want neural network accept tweet ie strings input need run similar function called encode below turn every character string value   store array fortunately javascript native method converting character ascii code called charcodeat use divide outcome max value extended ascii characters  we using extended ascii case encounter fringe case like é ⁄ ensure get value  also storing training data plain text encoded data ultimately feeding ai  thank later need another function called processtrainingdata below apply previously mentioned encoding function training data selectively converting text encoded characters returning array training data play nicely brainjs code look like this go ‘scriptsjs’ file something notice present example documentation shown earlier other two helper function already gone over line  train function save trained neural network global variable called trainednet  prevents u retrain neural network every time use it network trained saved variable call like function pas encoded input as shown line  execute function use ai alright indexhtml brainjs scriptsjs file finished need put something trainingdatajs ready go last least training data like mentioned storing tweet text encoding numeric value fly make life whole lot easier actually need copy  paste training data formatting necessary paste text add new row add ‘trainingdatajs’ file done note although example show  sample person used  each want sample take much space course neural network’s accuracy increase proportionally amount training data give it feel free use le see affect

different orientation said property called invariance specifically cnn invariant translation viewpoint size illumination or combination above essentially premise data augmentation real world scenario may dataset image taken limited set conditions but target application may exist variety conditions different orientation location scale brightness etc account situation training neural network additional synthetically modified data yes help increase amount relevant data dataset related way neural network learn let illustrate example imagine dataset consisting two brand cars shown above let u assume car brand aligned exactly like picture left ie car facing left  likewise car brand b aligned exactly like picture right ie facing right  now feed dataset “stateoftheart” neural network hope

prevent happening reduce amount irrelevant feature dataset car model classifier above simple solution would add picture car classes facing direction original dataset better yet flip image existing dataset horizontally face side now training neural network new dataset get performance intended get dive various augmentation techniques one issue must consider beforehand answer may seem quite obvious augmentation feed data model right yes two option here one option perform necessary transformation beforehand essentially increasing size dataset option perform transformation minibatch feeding machine learning model first option known offline augmentation method preferred relatively smaller datasets would end increasing size dataset factor equal number transformation perform for example flipping images would increase size dataset factor  second option known online augmentation augmentation fly method preferred larger datasets cannot afford explosive increase size instead would perform transformation minibatches would feed model machine learning framework support online augmentation accelerated gpu section present basic powerful augmentation technique popularly used explore techniques simplicity let u make one assumption assumption that need consider lie beyond image’s boundary use technique assumption valid would happen use technique force u guess lie beyond image’s boundary case need interpolate information discus detail cover type augmentation techniques also specify factor size dataset would get increased aka data augmentation factor flip image horizontally vertically framework provide function vertical flips but vertical flip equivalent rotating image  degree performing horizontal flip example image flipped perform flip using following commands favorite packages data augmentation factor    one key thing note operation image dimension may preserved rotation image square rotating right angle preserve image size rectangle rotating  degree would preserve size rotating image finer angle also change final image size see deal issue next section example square image rotated right angles perform rotation using following commands favorite packages data augmentation factor    image scaled outward inward scaling outward final image size larger original image size image framework cut section new image size equal original image deal scaling inward next section reduces image size forcing u make assumption lie beyond boundary example image scaled perform scaling using following commands using scikitimage data augmentation

method scaling perform random crop using following command tensorflow data augmentation factor  arbitrary translation involves moving image along x direction or both following example assume image black background beyond boundary translated appropriately method augmentation useful object located almost anywhere image force convolutional neural network look everywhere perform translation tensorflow using following commands data augmentation factor  arbitrary overfitting usually happens neural network try learn high frequency feature patterns occur lot may useful gaussian noise zero

models along magic transfer learning use augmentation wanted translate image black background wanted scale inward rotate finer angles perform transformations need preserve original image size since image information thing outside boundary need make assumptions usually space beyond image’s boundary assumed constant  every point hence transformations get black region image defined right assumption real world scenario mostly no image processing ml framework standard way decide fill unknown space defined follows simplest interpolation method fill unknown region constant value may work natural images work image taken monochromatic background edge value image extended boundary method work mild translations image pixel value reflected along image boundary method useful continuous natural background containing trees mountain etc method similar reflect except fact that boundary reflection copy edge pixel made normally reflect symmetric used interchangeably difference visible dealing small image patterns image repeated beyond boundary tiled method popularly used rest make sense lot scenarios besides these design method dealing undefined space usually method would fine

never see car presented orientations instance going classify random car road second image would make sense dataset but insurance company deal car accidents want identify model upsidedown broken car well third image make sense last image may make sense scenarios point is using augmentation techniques make sure increase irrelevant data probably expecting result motivate walk extra mile fair enough got covered too let prove augmentation really works using toy example replicate experiment verify let u create two neural network classify data one among four classes cat lion tiger leopard catch is

исследователей из массачусетского технологического института mit представила нейронную сеть norman которая распознает изображения и генерирует текстовое описание к ним ее особенность в том что ученые тренировали сеть на картинках с подписями о смерти из сообщества reddit и norman во всем видит ужасы алгоритм назван в честь персонажа романа “психо” — убийцы с раздвоением личности нормана бейтса специалисты хотели продемонстрировать важность данных на которых обучают модель а также их сбалансированность чтобы наглядно показать влияние данных на результат исследователи из mit показали

сотрудников компании против сотрудничества с пентагоном компания планировала создать искусственный интеллект для военных беспилотников по словам пичайа являясь лидером в ииразработках google чувствует огромную ответственность возложенную на плечи компании поэтому он объявил о семи принципах которых компания будет придерживаться в будущем он также отметил что использование ии должно быть “социально полезным” а при его разработке необходимо предусмотреть “надежные средства обеспечения безопасности” алгоритмы ии и собранные для них данные должны находиться под контролем людей а при их разработке должны быть учтены наивысшие научные стандарты и компания будет стремиться к тому чтобы “ограничить вред” использования таких систем tsnua инженеры компании google разработали алгоритм autoaugment который дополняет данные для обучения алгоритмов компьютерного зрения изображениями созданными на основе существующих алгоритм трансформирует обрезает отражает и изменяет цвета на изображениях что позволяет увеличить набор исходных данных для обучения для создания алгоритма специалисты компании использовали модель обучения с подкреплением в результате он научился самостоятельно определять правила по которым необходимо изменить изображение и создать уникальное не исказив его при этом autoaugment умеет отражать изображения по горизонтали и вертикали поворачивать менять цвет и так далее при этом алгоритм может комбинировать правила и предотвращать создание одинаковых копий так система учитывает специфику конкретного набора изображений в случае с номерами домов в наборе svhn алгоритм использует геометрические преобразования изображения а также изменение его цвета в наборах  и imagenet autoaugment не использует геометрические преобразования и не меняет цвет так как это правило может создать нереалистичную фотографию вместо этого алгоритм меняет оттенки на изображениях сохраняя при этом оригинальную цветовую гамму blog google ai калифорнийский университет в

fall trap abstracting away learning process — believing simply stack arbitrary layer together backprop “magically make work” data let u look explicit example case quite unintuitive ways starting easy here one point fashionable use sigmoid or tanh nonlinearities fully connected layers tricky part people might realize think backward pas sloppy weight initialization data preprocessing nonlinearities “saturate” entirely stop learning — training loss flat refuse go down example fully connected layer sigmoid nonlinearity computes using raw numpy weight matrix w initialized large output matrix

colleague mine asked question like “why many activation functions” “why one work better other” ”how know one use” “is hardcore maths” on thought write article familiar neural network basic level therefore wondering activation function “whyhowmathematics” note article assumes basic knowledge artificial “neuron” would recommend reading basic neural network reading article better understanding artificial neuron do simply put calculates “weighted sum” input add bias decides whether “fired”  yeah right activation function this let u go flow moment  consider neuron now value anything ranging inf inf neuron really know bound value decide whether neuron fire  firing pattern learnt biology way brain work brain working testimony awesome intelligent system  decided add “activation functions” purpose check value produced neuron decide whether outside connection consider neuron “fired” not rather let u say — “activated” not first thing come mind threshold based activation function value certain value declare activated le threshold say not hmm great could work activation function  “activated”  threshold else alternatively   y threshold  otherwise well “step function” see figure output   activated value   threshold output   activated otherwise great make activation function neuron confusions however certain drawback this understand better think following suppose creating binary classifier something say “yes” “no”  activate activate  step function could you exactly does say   now think use case would want multiple neuron connected bring classes    etc happen  neuron “activated” neuron output   step function would decide class it hmm hard complicated would want network activate  neuron others   would able say classified properlyidentified class  ah harder train converge way would better activation binary instead would say “ activated” “ activated” on  neuron activates could find neuron “highest activation”  better max softmax let u leave  case well  neuron say “ activated” problem still persistsi know butsince intermediate activation value output learning smoother easier  le wiggly  chance  neuron  activated lesser compared step function training  also depending training data  ok want something give u intermediate  analog  activation value rather saying “activated”  binary  first thing come mind would linear function  cx straight line function activation proportional input  weighted sum neuron  way give range activations binary activation definitely connect neuron together  fires could take max  softmax decide based that ok too problem this familiar gradient descent training would notice function derivative constant  cx derivative respect x c means gradient relationship x constant gradient descent going constant gradient error prediction change made back propagation constant depending change input deltax  good  always bear  another problem too think connected layers layer activated linear function activation turn go next level input second layer calculates weighted sum input turn fire based another linear activation function matter many layer have linear nature final activation function last layer nothing linear function input first layer pause bit think it mean two layer  n layer  replaced single layer ah lost ability stacking layer way matter stack whole network still equivalent single layer linear activation  combination linear function linear manner still another linear function  let u move on shall we well look smooth “step function like” benefit this think moment first thing first nonlinear nature combination function also nonlinear great stack layers non binary activations yes too give analog activation unlike step function smooth gradient too notice x value   value steep means small change value x region value change significantly ah mean function tendency bring value either end curve look like good classifier considering property yes  indeed is tends bring activation either side curve  x   x   example making clear distinction prediction another advantage activation function is unlike linear function output activation function always going range  compared inf inf linear function activation bound range nice blow activation then great sigmoid function one widely used activation function today problem this notice towards either end sigmoid function value tend respond le change x mean gradient region going small give rise problem “vanishing gradients” hmm happens activation reach near “nearhorizontal” part curve either sides gradient small vanished  cannot make significant change extremely small value  network refuse learn drastically slow  depending use case gradient computation get hit floating point value limit  way work around problem sigmoid still popular classification problems another activation function used tanh function hm look similar sigmoid fact scaled sigmoid function ok characteristic similar sigmoid discussed above nonlinear nature great stack layers bound range   worry activation blowing up one point mention gradient stronger tanh sigmoid  derivative steeper deciding sigmoid tanh depend requirement gradient strength like sigmoid tanh also vanishing gradient problem tanh also popular widely used activation function later come relu function ax   relu function shown above give output x x positive  otherwise first look would look like problem linear function linear positive axis first all relu nonlinear nature combination relu also non linear  fact good approximator function approximated combination relu great mean stack layers bound though range relu  inf mean blow activation another point would like discus sparsity activation imagine big neural network lot neurons using sigmoid tanh almost neuron fire analog way  remember  mean almost activation processed describe output network word activation dense costly would ideally want neuron network activate thereby making activation sparse efficient relu give u benefit imagine network random initialized weight  normalised  almost  network yield  activation characteristic relu  output  negative value x  mean fewer neuron firing  sparse activation  network lighter woah nice relu seems awesome yes is nothing flawless even relu horizontal line relu negative x  gradient go towards  activation region relu gradient  weight get adjusted descent means neuron go state stop responding variation error input  simply gradient  nothing change  called dying relu problem problem several neuron die respond making substantial part network passive variation relu mitigate issue simply making horizontal line nonhorizontal component  example    make slightly inclined line rather horizontal line leaky relu variation too main idea let gradient non zero recover training eventually relu le computationally expensive tanh sigmoid involves simpler mathematical operations good point consider designing deep neural nets now activation function use mean use relu everything do sigmoid tanh well yes no know function trying approximate certain characteristics choose activation function approximate function faster leading faster training process example sigmoid work well classifier  see graph sigmoid show property ideal classifier  approximating classifier function combination sigmoid easier maybe relu example lead faster training process convergence use custom function too know nature

del procesamiento del lenguaje natural esta detección de patrones permite clasificar documentos lo que tiene muchas aplicaciones análisis de sentimiento sentiment analysisrecuperación de documentos document retrieval búsqueda web filtrado de spam etc esta clasificación se hace de manera automática de forma supervisada supervisada también conocida como clustering de documentos entre la técnicas más clásicas utilizadas generalmente supervisadas encontramos clasificadores naive bayes árboles de decisión   tfidf latent semantic indexing lsi support vector machine svm algunas técnicas utilizadas para extraer características suelen inspirarse en cómo el ser humano e capaz de aprender de información simple llegar información más compleja se pueden diferenciar entre redes neuronales algunas topologías de redes neuronales se engloban dentro del concepto ‘deep learning’ técnicas que usan estas redes para reconocer patrones en beeva hemos encontrado varias veces con un mismo problema ¿cómo sabemos si documentos son semejantes y con “semejantes” queremos decir que tratan de lo mismo esto entre otras cosas permitiría categorizar documentos dentro del mismo tema de manera automática así que priori encontramos con retos necesitamos representar los documentos de manera que los algoritmos que usemos los puedan entender normalmente estas representaciones modelos están basadas en matrix de características que posee cada documento para representar textos podemos usar técnicas de representación de manera local de manera continua la representación local e aquella en la que solo tenemos en cuenta la palabras de forma aislada se representa como un conjunto de términos índice palabras clave ngramas bagofwords este tipo de representación tiene en cuenta la relación entre términos la representacióncontinua e aquella en la que sí se tiene en cuenta el contexto de la palabras la relación entre ellas se representan como matrices vectores conjuntos e incluso nodos lsa lsi lds lda representaciones distribuidas predictivas usando redes neuronales para nuestro primer reto extraer semántica vamos probar una representación continuum llamada representación distribuida de palabras distributed representation words esta consiste en aprender representaciones vectoriales de palabras e decir vamos tener un espacio multidimensional en el que una palabra e representada como un vector una de la cosas interesantes de estos vectores e que son capaces de extraer características tan relevantes como propiedades sintácticas semánticas de la palabras turian et al  la otra e que este aprendizaje automático se realiza con datos de entrada etiquetados e decir e supervisado estos vectores pueden ser utilizados como entrada de muchas aplicaciones de procesamiento del lenguaje natural machine learning de hecho e nuestro segundo reto utilizaremos estos vectores para intentar extraer temas de documentos para aplicar esta técnica usamos la herramienta  mikolov et al — google  que utiliza como entrada un corpusde textos documentos cualquiera obtener como salida vectores representando la palabras la arquitectura en la que se basa  utiliza redes neuronales para aprender estas representaciones aunque también se pueden obtener vectores que representen frases párrafos incluso documentos completos le mikolov  primero utilizamos la implementación en python de la herramienta  incluida en la librería gensim como entrada para generar los vectores tenemos datasets con documentos en castellano wikipedia yahoo answer de este dataset solo los que están en españold el proceso e el siguiente figura  dado el conjunto de textos se construye un vocabulario  aprende la representaciones vectoriales de palabras los algoritmos de aprendizaje que utiliza  son bagofwords continuo skipgram continuo ambo algoritmos aprenden la representaciones de una palabra la cuales son yoútiles para predecir otras palabras en la frase como sabemos que los vectores capturan muchas regularidades lingüísticas podemos aplicar operaciones vectoriales para extraer muchas propiedades interesantes por ejemplo si queremos saber qué palabras son la más similares una dada buscamos cuales están más cerca aplicando ‘distancia coseno’ cosine distance ‘similitud coseno’ cosine similarity por ejemplo con el modelo de wikipedia qué cinco palabras se parecen más una dada también podemos obtener qué seis palabras se parecen más dada con el modelo de la wikipedia el de yahoo para ver la diferencias otra propiedad interesante e que la operaciones vectoriales vectorrey — vectorhombre  vectormujer da como resultado un vector muy cercano vectorreina por ejemplo vectorpareja — vectorhombre  vectornovio da como resultado estos vectores al haber trabajado con conjuntos de datos diferentes wikipedia yahoo answers podemos crear espacios de representaciones vectoriales ligeramente diferentes con respecto al vocabulario usado la semántica inherente en ellos en el de yahoo encontramos entre la palabras más similares la misma palabra mal escrita de diferentes maneras en wikipedia esto pasa pues la escritura e mucho más correcta además en el conjunto de yahoo tenemos sólo preguntas en castellano sino que también encontramos otras en mejicano argentino otros dialectos de sudamérica esto permite encontrar palabras similares en diferentes dialectos con respecto al tiempo que tardamos en crear nuestro espacio de vectores la mayoría del tiempo se dedica al preprocesamiento limpieza de esos documentos la implementación de gensim permite modificar los parámetros de creación del modelo e incluso utilizar varios worker con cython para que el entrenamiento sea más rápido la calidad de estos vectores dependerá de la cantidad de datos de entrenamiento del tamaño de los vectores del algoritmo elegido para entrenar para obtener mejores resultados e necesario entrenar los modelos con datasets grandes con suficiente dimensionalidad para más detalles recomendamos la lectura del trabajo de mikolov le en la siguiente tabla mostramos el tiempo que se tarda aproximadamente en entrenar unos  mb de datos suficientes para obtener un buen modelo de vectores el tiempo total e el tiempo que tardamos en preprocesar los datos entrenar guardar el modelo para posteriores usos para usar representaciones vectoriales de documentos hemos utilizado  también de gensim como entrada de datos hemos considerado documento como una página de la wikipedia una pregunta de yahoo con sus respuestas hemos variado el tamaño del fichero de entrada de  documentos  para un worker una dimensión de  el tiempo de entrenamiento se reduce bastante lo podemos ver en la siguiente tabla los test ejecutados para ver el comportamiento del espacio de vectores han sido tan satisfactorios como con  los resultados para palabras similares son peores que con  para encontrar documentos similares uno dado vemos que devuelve nada con mucho sentido como alternativa buscamos otros métodos que puedan decir qué documentos son parecidos entre sí los presentaremos en el siguiente post  e considerado como un método inspirado en deep learning recomiendo la lectura de este artículo para aclarar conceptos en ciertos grupos de especialistas en la materia tanto ‘deep learning’ sino ‘shallow learning’ en otros grupos sea como sea la creación de espacios vectoriales para extraer propiedades sintácticas semánticas de la palabras de manera automática supervisada abre todo un mundo de posibilidades explorar estos vectores sirven de entrada para muchas aplicaciones como traducción automática clusterización categorización e incluso puede ser entrada de otros modelos basados en deep learning e que además de aplicarse al lenguaje natural se está aplicando también en tógenes reconocimiento de voz ya que  ha gustado mucho nuestro siguiente paso e aplicar estos espacios vectoriales extraer

understanding differential calculus perhaps intuition machine learning is hope come blog post acute existent nonetheless understanding neural network train them let u know succeeded let u start quick introduction concept neural networks fundamentally neural network nothing really good function approximators — give trained network input vector performs series operations produce output vector train network estimate unknown function give collection data point — denote “training set” — network learn generalize make future inferences neural network structured series layers composed one neuron as depicted above neuron produce output activation based output previous layer set weights using neural network approximate function data forwarded network layerbylayer reach final layer final layer’s activation prediction network actually makes probably seems kind magical actually works key finding right set weight connection make right decision this happens process known training — post going about training network often convenient metric good bad doing call metric cost function generally speaking cost function look function network inferred us estimate value data point training set discrepancy output estimation training set data point principle value cost function training network goal get value cost function low possible we see bit now focus intuition cost function good for generally speaking cost function le convex like so reality impossible network cost function truly convex however soon see local minimum may big deal long still general trend u follow get bottom also notice cost function parameterized network’s weight — control loss function changing weights one last thing keep mind loss function capture correctly network estimate — specify objective need optimized example generally want penalize larger weights could lead overfitting case simply adding regularization term cost function express big weight mean that process training network look solution best estimate possible preventing overfitting now let u take look actually minimize cost function training process find set weight work best objective developed metric “scoring” network which denote jw need find weight make score low possible think back precalculus days first instinct might set derivative cost function zero solve would give u location every minimummaximum function unfortunately problem approach especially size network begin scale up solving weight directly becomes increasingly infeasible instead look different class algorithms called iterative optimization algorithms progressively work way towards optimal solution basic algorithm gradient descent recall cost function essentially convex want get close possible global minimum instead solving analytically gradient descent follows derivative essentially “roll” slope find way center let u take example singleweight neural network whose cost function depicted below start initializing weight randomly put u red dot diagram above taking derivative see slope point pretty big positive number want move closer center — naturally take pretty big step opposite direction slope repeat process enough soon find nearly bottom curve much closer optimal weight configuration network formally gradient descent look something like this let u dissect every time want update weights subtract derivative cost function wrt weight itself scaled learning rate  — it see get closer closer center derivative term get smaller smaller converging zero approach solution process applies network tens hundreds thousands parameter — compute gradient cost function wrt weights update weight accordingly want say word learning rate one important hyperparameters “settings” neural network control over learning rate high could jump far direction never get minimum searching for set low network take age find right weights get stuck local minimum “magic number” use come learning rate usually best try several pick one work best individual network dataset practice many choose anneal learning rate time — start high furthest solution decay get closer turn out gradient descent kind slow really slow actually earlier used analogy weight “rolling” gradient get bottom actually make sense — pick speed get bottom slow down another iterative optimization algorithm known momentum that weight begin “roll” slope pick speed get closer solution momentum picked carry closer optimum gradient descent would simply stop result training momentum update faster provide better results update rule look like momentum train accumulate “velocity” value v training step update v gradient current position once scaled learning rate also notice that time step decay velocity v factor mu usually somewhere around  time lose momentum instead bouncing around minimum forever update weight direction velocity repeat process again first training iterations v grow weight “pick speed” take successively bigger leaps approach minimum velocity stop accumulating quickly eventually begin decay essentially reached minimum important thing note accumulate velocity independently weight — one weight changing particularly clearly mean weight need be lot iterative optimization algorithm commonly used neural networks go if curious popular one include adagrad adam basic principle remains throughout — gradually update weight get closer minimum regardless optimization algorithm use still need able compute gradient cost function wrt weight cost function simple parabola anymore — complicated manydimensional function countless local optimum need watch for backpropagation come in backpropagation algorithm major milestone machine learning because discovered optimization method extremely unsatisfactory one popular method perturb adjust weight random uninformed direction ie increase decrease see performance ann increased not one would attempt either a go direction b reduce perturbation size c combination both another attempt use genetic algorithm which became popular ai time evolve highperformance neural network cases without analytically informed correct direction result efficiency suboptimal backpropagation algorithm come play recall that given supervised machine learning problem aim to select weight provide optimal estimation function model training data words want find set weight w minimizes output jw discussed gradient descent

arbitrary weight for example  would iteratively apply chain rule which sure remember calculus classes result would look similar following now let u attach black box tail neural network black box compute return error — using cost function — output done add another functional dependency error function output hence function input weights activation function compute derivative error arbitrary weight again choose  result would be derivative simplified choose activation error function entire result would represent numerical value point abstraction removed error derivative used gradient

optimization algorithm call “backpropagation” almost seems traversing output error weights taking iterative step using chain rule “reach” weight first truly understood backprop algorithm just couple week ago taken aback simple was sure actual arithmeticcomputations difficult process handled computers reality backpropagation rather tedious but again generalized implementation computer handle this application chain rule since neural network convoluted multilayer machine learning model structure at least relative ones weight “contributes” overall error complex manner hence actual derivative require lot effort produce however get past calculus backpropagation neural net equivalent typical gradient descent logisticlinear regression thus far walked abstract form backprop simple neural

compute “error” neural network based output prediction produce vs correct priori output know training set formally denote predicted output estimation vector p actual output vector a use one example possible cost function the loglikelihood also popular one use mathematical convenience this notion one frequently encounter machine learning squared expression exaggerates poor solution ensures

used pizj — again computer scientist mathematicians need pedantic legality intricacy expressions need intuition expression implymean almost succinct form psuedocode so even though defines arbitrary weight know mean connecting weight also see diagram walk pj arbitrary zj walk along connecting weight now have point like continue playing “reduction test” reduction test state that simplify derivative term still backprop do since cannot yet quite put derivative zj wrt  numerical term let u keep going and fastforward bit using chain rule follow fourth line back determine that since zj sigmoid zi use logic previous layer apply sigmoid derivative derivative zi wrt  demonstrated fifth lines back requires idea “spreading out” summation contributions briefly since zi weighted sum yj y sum derivative which similar before simplifies relevant connecting weight preceding layer  case almost there let u go further still reduction do have course another sigmoid activation function deal with sixth red line notice now one line remaining fact last derivative term pass or rather fails reduction test last line traverse input yi xj walking along  wait second — attempting backprop to yes is since are first time directly deriving yi wrt weight  think coefficient  xj weighted sum instead vice versa used previously hence simplification follows course since xj layer x contributes weighted sum yi sum effects it cannot reduce here now let u tie individual expression together edit denominator left hand side say  instead “layer” partial derivative term left work complete give u derivative

founder chatbots life help company create great chatbots  ai system share insight along way latest news info tutorial artificial intelligence machine learning deep learning big data mean humanity recently colleague mine asked question like “why many activation functions” “why one work better other” ”how know one use” “is hardcore maths” on thought write article familiar neural network basic level therefore wondering activation function “whyhowmathematics” note article assumes basic knowledge artificial “neuron” would recommend reading basic neural network reading article better understanding artificial neuron do simply put calculates “weighted sum” input add bias decides whether “fired”  yeah right activation function this let u go flow moment  consider neuron now value anything ranging inf inf neuron really know bound value decide whether neuron fire  firing pattern learnt biology way brain work brain working testimony awesome intelligent system  decided add “activation functions” purpose check value produced neuron decide whether outside connection consider neuron “fired” not rather let u say — “activated” not first thing come mind threshold based activation function value certain value declare activated le threshold say not hmm great could work activation function  “activated”  threshold else alternatively   y threshold  otherwise well “step function” see figure output   activated value   threshold output   activated otherwise great make activation function neuron confusions however certain drawback this understand better think following suppose creating binary classifier something say “yes” “no”  activate activate  step function could you exactly does say   now think use case would want multiple neuron connected bring classes    etc happen  neuron “activated” neuron output   step function would decide class it hmm hard complicated would want network activate  neuron others   would able say classified properlyidentified class  ah harder train converge way would better activation binary instead would say “ activated” “ activated” on  neuron activates could find neuron “highest activation”  better max softmax let u leave  case well  neuron say “ activated” problem still persistsi know butsince intermediate activation value output learning smoother easier  le wiggly  chance  neuron  activated lesser compared step function training  also depending training data  ok want something give u intermediate  analog  activation value rather saying “activated”  binary  first thing come mind would linear function  cx straight line function activation proportional input  weighted sum neuron  way give range activations binary activation definitely connect neuron together  fires could take max  softmax decide based that ok too problem this familiar gradient descent training would notice function derivative constant  cx derivative respect x c means gradient relationship x constant gradient descent going constant gradient error prediction change made back propagation constant depending change input deltax  good  always bear  another problem too think connected layers layer activated linear function activation turn go next level input second layer calculates weighted sum input turn fire based another linear activation function matter many layer have linear nature final activation function last layer nothing linear function input first layer pause bit think it mean two layer  n layer  replaced single layer ah lost ability stacking layer way matter stack whole network still equivalent single layer linear activation  combination linear function linear manner still another linear function  let u move on shall we well look smooth “step function like” benefit this think moment first thing first nonlinear nature combination function also nonlinear great stack layers non binary activations yes too give analog activation unlike step function smooth gradient too notice x value   value steep means small change value x region value change significantly ah mean function tendency bring value either end curve look like good classifier considering property yes  indeed is tends bring activation either side curve  x   x   example making clear distinction prediction another advantage activation function is unlike linear function output activation function always going range  compared inf inf linear function activation bound range nice blow activation then great sigmoid function one widely used activation function today problem this notice towards either end sigmoid function value tend respond le change x mean gradient region going small give rise problem “vanishing gradients” hmm happens activation reach near “nearhorizontal” part curve either sides gradient small vanished  cannot make significant change extremely small value  network refuse learn drastically slow  depending use case gradient computation get hit floating point value limit  way work around problem sigmoid still popular classification problems another activation function used tanh function hm look similar sigmoid fact scaled sigmoid function ok characteristic similar sigmoid discussed above nonlinear nature great stack layers bound range   worry activation blowing up one point mention gradient stronger tanh sigmoid  derivative steeper deciding sigmoid tanh depend requirement gradient strength like sigmoid tanh also vanishing gradient problem tanh also popular widely used activation function later come relu function ax   relu function shown above give output x x positive  otherwise first look would look like problem linear function linear positive axis first all relu nonlinear nature combination relu also non linear  fact good approximator function approximated combination relu great mean stack layers bound though range relu  inf mean blow activation another point would like discus sparsity activation imagine big neural network lot neurons using sigmoid tanh almost neuron fire analog way  remember  mean almost activation processed describe output network word activation dense costly would ideally want neuron network activate thereby making activation sparse efficient relu give u benefit imagine network random initialized weight  normalised  almost  network yield  activation characteristic relu  output  negative value x  mean fewer neuron firing  sparse activation  network lighter woah nice relu seems awesome yes is nothing flawless even relu horizontal line relu negative x  gradient go towards  activation region relu gradient  weight get adjusted descent means neuron go state stop responding variation error input  simply gradient  nothing change  called dying relu problem problem several neuron die respond making substantial part network passive variation relu mitigate issue simply making horizontal line nonhorizontal component  example    make slightly inclined line rather horizontal line leaky relu variation too main idea let gradient non zero recover training eventually relu le computationally expensive tanh sigmoid involves simpler mathematical operations good point consider designing deep neural nets now activation function use mean use relu everything do sigmoid tanh well yes no know function trying approximate certain characteristics choose activation function approximate function faster leading faster training process example sigmoid work well classifier  see graph sigmoid show property ideal classifier  approximating classifier function combination sigmoid easier maybe relu example lead faster training process convergence use custom function too know nature function trying learn maybe would suggest start relu work backwards relu work time general approximator article tried describe activation function used commonly activation function too general idea remains same research better activation function still ongoing hope got idea behind activation function used decide one use quick cheer standing ovation clap show

marcus  outlined ten challenge deep learning suggested deep learning itself although useful unlikely lead artificial general intelligence suggested instead deep learning viewed “not universal solvent simply one tool among many” place pure deep learning called hybrid models would incorporate supervised form deep learning also technique well symbolmanipulation unsupervised learning itself possibly reconceptualized also urged community consider incorporating innate structure ai systems within days thousand people weighed twitter enthusiastic “eg best discussion deeplearning ai read many years” “thoughtful mostly wrong nevertheless” think clarity around issue important compiled list fourteen commonlyasked queries unsupervised learning fit in say nice thing deep learning give right talk stuff first place asking neural network generalize even number odd numbers hint important one lot more addressed literally every question seen tried representative  general intelligence thomas dietterich eminent professor machine learning thorough explicit critic thus far gave nice answer comfortable with  marcus nice deep learning said nice thing vast accomplishments minimizes others dietterich mentioned above made points writing first part that true could said positive things like say any even like forgot mention dietterich’s best example mentioned first page generally later article cited

note  bottom  marcus say deep learning useless great many thing course useful never said otherwise a current supervised form deep learning might approaching limit b limit would stop short full artificial general intelligence — unless maybe started incorporating bunch stuff like symbolmanipulation innateness core conclusion this  “one thing understand — garymarcus say dl good hierarchical

 marcus said problem supervised learning deep learning yann lecun presented version this comment facebook page part allegedly recognizing lecun’s recent work is well odd true could find good summary

binary digit zero training way network know get one position” example vincent lostenlan postdoc cornell said dietterich made essentially point concisely although right oddsandevens in context hard deep learning wrong larger issue three reasons first cannot people cannot extrapolate did two different examples top section paraphrasing chico marx going believe eyes someone immersed deeply —

need solution challenge ever catch human learning — even mean shaking assumptions now might reasonably objected fair fight human manifestly depend prior knowledge generalize mappings in sense dieterrich proposed objection later tweet stream true enough way point neural network certain sort good way incorporating right sort prior knowledge place precisely network way incorporating prior

ridge regression one particular way combining several prediction used kagglewinning machine learning practitioners applied deep learning ensembling used combine prediction several neural network produce one final prediction usually good idea use neural network different architecture ensemble likely make mistake different training sample therefore benefit ensembling larger however also
